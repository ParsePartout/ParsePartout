Abstract :
			In order to better adapt to society, an association has developed a web chat application that allows anyone to express and share their concerns and anguishes. Several thousand anonymous conversations have been gathered and form a new corpus of stories about human distress and social violence. We present a method of corpus analysis combining unsupervised learning and word embedding in order to bring out the themes of this particular collection. We compare this approach with a standard algorithm of the literature on a labeled corpus and obtain very good results. An interpretation of the obtained clusters collection confirms the interest of the method.

Intro :
			null			Extensive experiments on query-oriented multi- 
			document summarization have been carried out 
			over the past few years. Most of the strategies 
			to produce summaries are based on an extrac- 
			tion method, which identifies salient textual seg- 
			ments, most often sentences, in documents. Sen- 
			tences containing the most salient concepts are se- 
			lected, ordered and assembled according to their 
			relevance to produce summaries (also called ex- 
			tracts) (Mani and Maybury, 1999). 
			Recently emerged from the Document Under- 
			standing Conference (DUC) 20071, update sum- 
			marization attempts to enhance summarization 
			when more information about knowledge acquired 
			by the user is available. It asks the following ques- 
			tion: has the user already read documents on the 
			topic? In the case of a positive answer, producing 
			an extract focusing on only new facts is of inter- 
			est. In this way, an important issue is introduced:

			rhetorical relations. In the first case, the satellite 
			gives additional information about the other one, 
			the nucleus, on which it depends (ex. Result, 
			Condition, Elaboration or Concession). In the 
			second case, several elements, all nuclei, are 
			connected at the same level, that is, there are no 
			elements dependent on others and they all have the 
			same importance with regard to the intentions of 
			the author of the text (ex. Contrast, List, Joint or 
			Sequence). The rhetorical analysis of a text by 
			means of RST includes 3 phases: segmentation, 
			detection of relations and building of hierarchical 
			rhetorical trees. For more information about RST 
			we recommend the original article of Mann and

			(Taboada and Mann, 2006b). Nevertheless, most of

			There is a big gap between the summaries produced 
			by current automatic summarizers and the abstracts 
			written by human professionals. Certainly one fac- 
			tor contributing to this gap is that automatic sys- 
			tems can not always correctly identify the important 
			topics of an article. Another factor, however, which 
			has received little attention, is that automatic sum- 
			marizers have poor text generation techniques. Most 
			automatic summarizers rely on extracting key sen- 
			tences or paragraphs from an article to produce a 
			summary. Since the extracted sentences are discon- 
			nected in the original article, when they are strung 
			together, the resulting summary can be inconcise, 
			incoherent, and sometimes even misleading. 
			We present a cut and paste based text sum- 
			marization technique, aimed at reducing the gap 
			between automatically generated summaries and 
			human-written abstracts. Rather than focusing 
			on how to identify key sentences, as do other re- 
			searchers, we study how to generate the text of a 
			summary once key sentences have been extracted. 
			The main idea of cut and paste summarization 
			is to reuse the text in an article to generate the 
			summary. However, instead of simply extracting 
			sentences as current summarizers do, the cut and 
			paste system will "smooth" the extracted sentences 
			by editing them. Such edits mainly involve cutting 
			phrases and pasting them together in novel ways. 
			The key features of this work are: 
			(1) The identification of cutting and past- 
			ing operations. We identified six operations that 
			can be used alone or together to transform extracted 
			sentences into sentences in human-written abstracts. 
			The operations were identified based on manual and 
			automatic comparison of human-written abstracts 
			and the original articles. Examples include sentence 
			reduction, sentence combination, syntactic transfor- 
			mation, and lexical paraphrasing. 
			(2) Development of an automatic system to 
			perform cut and paste operations. Two opera- 
			tions - sentence reduction and sentence combination 
			- are most effective in transforming extracted sen- 
			tences into summary sentences that are as concise 
			and coherent as in human-written abstracts. We 
			implemented a sentence reduction module that re- 
			moves extraneous phrases from extracted sentences, 
			and a sentence combination module that merges the 
			extracted sentences or the reduced forms resulting 
			from sentence reduction. Our sentence reduction 
			model determines what to cut based on multiple 
			sources of information, including syntactic knowl- 
			edge, context, and statistics learned from corpus 
			analysis. It improves the conciseness of extracted 
			sentences, making them concise and on target. Our 
			sentence combination module implements combina- 
			tion rules that were identified by observing examples 
			written by human professionals. It improves the co- 
			herence of extracted sentences. 
			(3) Decomposing human-wrltten summary 
			sentences. The cut and paste technique we propose 
			here is a new computational model which we based 
			on analysis of human-written abstracts. To do this 
			analysis, we developed an automatic system that can 
			match a phrase in a human-written abstract to the 
			corresponding phrase in the article, identifying its 
			most likely location. This decomposition program 
			allows us to analyze the construction of sentences 
			in a human-written abstract. Its results have been 
			used to train and test the sentence reduction and 
			sentence combination module. 
			In Section 2, we discuss the cut and paste tech- 
			nique in general, from both a professional and com- 
			putational perspective. We also describe the six cut 
			and paste operations. In Section 3, we describe the 
			178 
			system architecture. The major components of the 
			system, including sentence reduction, sentence com- 
			bination, decomposition, and sentence selection, are 
			described in Section 4. The evaluation results are 
			shown in Section 5. Related work is discussed in 
			Section 6. Finally, we conclude and discuss future 
			work.

			on how to identify key sentences, as do other re- 
			searchers, we study how to generate the text of a 
			summary once key sentences have been extracted. 
			The main idea of cut and paste summarization 
			is to reuse the text in an article to generate the 
			summary. However, instead of simply extracting 
			sentences as current summarizers do, the cut and 
			paste system will "smooth" the extracted sentences 
			by editing them. Such edits mainly involve cutting 
			phrases and pasting them together in novel ways. 
			The key features of this work are: 
			(1) The identification of cutting and past- 
			ing operations. We identified six operations that 
			can be used alone or together to transform extracted 
			sentences into sentences in human-written abstracts. 
			The operations were identified based on manual and 
			automatic comparison of human-written abstracts 
			and the original articles. Examples include sentence 
			reduction, sentence combination, syntactic transfor- 
			mation, and lexical paraphrasing. 
			(2) Development of an automatic system to 
			perform cut and paste operations. Two opera- 
			tions - sentence reduction and sentence combination 
			- are most effective in transforming extracted sen- 
			tences into summary sentences that are as concise 
			and coherent as in human-written abstracts. We 
			implemented a sentence reduction module that re- 
			moves extraneous phrases from extracted sentences, 
			and a sentence combination module that merges the 
			extracted sentences or the reduced forms resulting 
			from sentence reduction. Our sentence reduction 
			model determines what to cut based on multiple 
			sources of information, including syntactic knowl- 
			edge, context, and statistics learned from corpus 
			analysis. It improves the conciseness of extracted 
			sentences, making them concise and on target. Our 
			sentence combination module implements combina- 
			tion rules that were identified by observing examples 
			written by human professionals. It improves the co- 
			herence of extracted sentences. 
			(3) Decomposing human-wrltten summary 
			sentences. The cut and paste technique we propose 
			here is a new computational model which we based 
			on analysis of human-written abstracts. To do this 
			analysis, we developed an automatic system that can 
			match a phrase in a human-written abstract to the 
			corresponding phrase in the article, identifying its 
			most likely location. This decomposition program 
			allows us to analyze the construction of sentences 
			in a human-written abstract. Its results have been 
			used to train and test the sentence reduction and 
			sentence combination module. 
			In Section 2, we discuss the cut and paste tech- 
			nique in general, from both a professional and com- 
			putational perspective. We also describe the six cut 
			and paste operations. In Section 3, we describe the 
			178 
			system architecture. The major components of the 
			system, including sentence reduction, sentence com- 
			bination, decomposition, and sentence selection, are 
			described in Section 4. The evaluation results are 
			shown in Section 5. Related work is discussed in 
			Section 6. Finally, we conclude and discuss future 
			work.

Corps :			null			2 Method 
			The underlying idea of our method is that as the 
			number of sentences in the history increases, the 
			likelihood to have redundant information within 
			candidate sentences also increases. We propose 
			a scalable sentence scoring method derived from 
			MMR that, as the size of the history increases, 
			gives more importance to non-redundancy that to 
			query relevance. We define H to represent the pre- 
			viously read documents (history), Q to represent 
			the query and s the candidate sentence. The fol- 
			lowing subsections formally define the similarity 
			measures and the scalable MMR scoring method. 
			2.1 A query-oriented multi-document 
			summarizer 
			We have first started by implementing a simple 
			summarizer for which the task is to produce query- 
			focused summaries from clusters of documents. 
			Each document is pre-processed: documents are 
			segmented into sentences, sentences are filtered 
			(words which do not carry meaning are removed 
			such as functional words or common words) and 
			normalized using a lemmas database (i.e. inflected 
			forms "go", "goes", "went", "gone"... are replaced 
			by "go"). An N-dimensional term-space , where 
			N is the number of different terms found in the 
			cluster, is constructed. Sentences are represented 
			in  by vectors in which each component is the 
			term frequency within the sentence. Sentence scor- 
			ing can be seen as a passage retrieval task in Infor- 
			mation Retrieval (IR). Each sentence s is scored by 
			computing a combination of two similarity mea- 
			sures between the sentence and the query. The first 
			measure is the well known cosine angle (Salton et 
			al., 1975) between the sentence and the query vec- 
			torial representations in  (denoted respectively s 
			and Q). The second similarity measure is based 
			on the Jaro-Winkler distance (Winkler, 1999). The 
			original Jaro-Winkler measure, denoted JW, uses 
			the number of matching characters and transposi- 
			tions to compute a similarity score between two 
			terms, giving more favourable ratings to terms that 
			match from the beginning. We have extended this 
			measure to calculate the similarity between the 
			sentence s and the query Q: 
			JWe(s, Q) = 
			1 
			|Q| 
			* 
			qQ 
			max 
			mS 
			JW(q, m) (1) 
			where S is the term set of s in which the terms 
			m that already have maximized JW(q, m) are re- 
			moved. The use of JWe smooths normalization and 
			misspelling errors. Each sentence s is scored using 
			the linear combination: 
			Sim1(s, Q) =  * cosine(s, Q) 
			+ (1 - ) * JWe(s, Q) (2) 
			where  = 0.7, optimally tuned on the past DUCs 
			data (2005 and 2006). The system produces a list 
			of ranked sentences from which the summary is 
			constructed by arranging the high scored sentences 
			until the desired size is reached. 
			2.2 A scalable MMR approach 
			MMR re-ranking algorithm has been successfully 
			used in query-oriented summarization (Ye et al., 
			2005). It strives to reduce redundancy while main- 
			taining query relevance in selected sentences. The 
			summary is constructed incrementally from a list 
			of ranked sentences, at each iteration the sentence 
			which maximizes MMR is chosen: 
			MMR = arg max 
			sS 
			[  * Sim1(s, Q) 
			- (1 - ) * max 
			sjE 
			Sim2(s, sj) ] (3) 
			where S is the set of candidates sentences and E 
			is the set of selected sentences.  represents an 
			interpolation coefficient between sentence's rele- 
			vance and non-redundancy. Sim2(s, sj) is a nor- 
			malized Longest Common Substring (LCS) mea- 
			sure between sentences s and sj. Detecting sen- 
			tence rehearsals, LCS is well adapted for redun- 
			dancy removal. 
			We propose an interpretation of MMR to tackle 
			the update summarization issue. Since Sim1 and 
			Sim2 are ranged in [0, 1], they can be seen as prob- 
			abilities even though they are not. Just as rewriting 
			(3) as (NR stands for Novelty Relevance): 
			NR = arg max 
			sS 
			[  * Sim1(s, Q) 
			+ (1 - ) * (1 - max 
			shH 
			Sim2(s, sh)) ] (4) 
			We can understand that (4) equates to an OR com- 
			bination. But as we are looking for a more intu- 
			itive AND and since the similarities are indepen- 
			dent, we have to use the product combination. The 
			24 
			scoring method defined in (2) is modified into a 
			double maximization criterion in which the best 
			ranked sentence will be the most relevant to the 
			query AND the most different to the sentences in 
			H. 
			SMMR(s) = Sim1(s, Q) 
			* 1 - max 
			shH 
			Sim2(s, sh) 
			f(H) 
			(5) 
			Decreasing  in (3) with the length of the sum- 
			mary was suggested by (Murray et al., 2005) and 
			successfully used in the DUC 2005 by (Hachey 
			et al., 2005), thereby emphasizing the relevance 
			at the outset but increasingly prioritizing redun- 
			dancy removal as the process continues. Sim- 
			ilarly, we propose to follow this assumption in 
			SMMR using a function denoted f that as the 
			amount of data in history increases, prioritize non- 
			redundancy (f(H)  0). 
			3 Experiments 
			The method described in the previous section has 
			been implemented and evaluated by using the 
			DUC 2007 update corpus2. The following subsec- 
			tions present details of the different experiments 
			we have conducted. 
			3.1 The DUC 2007 update corpus 
			We used for our experiments the DUC 2007 up- 
			date competition data set. The corpus is composed 
			of 10 topics, with 25 documents per topic. The up- 
			date task goal was to produce short (100 words) 
			multi-document update summaries of newswire ar- 
			ticles under the assumption that the user has al- 
			ready read a set of earlier articles. The purpose 
			of each update summary will be to inform the 
			reader of new information about a particular topic. 
			Given a DUC topic and its 3 document clusters: A 
			(10 documents), B (8 documents) and C (7 doc- 
			uments), the task is to create from the documents 
			three brief, fluent summaries that contribute to sat- 
			isfying the information need expressed in the topic 
			statement. 
			1. A summary of documents in cluster A. 
			2. An update summary of documents in B, un- 
			der the assumption that the reader has already 
			read documents in A. 
			2More information about the DUC 2007 corpus is avail- 
			able at http://duc.nist.gov/. 
			3. An update summary of documents in C, un- 
			der the assumption that the reader has already 
			read documents in A and B. 
			Within a topic, the document clusters must be pro- 
			cessed in chronological order. Our system gener- 
			ates a summary for each cluster by arranging the 
			high ranked sentences until the limit of 100 words 
			is reached. 
			3.2 Evaluation 
			Most existing automated evaluation methods work 
			by comparing the generated summaries to one or 
			more reference summaries (ideally, produced by 
			humans). To evaluate the quality of our generated 
			summaries, we choose to use the ROUGE3 (Lin, 
			2004) evaluation toolkit, that has been found to be 
			highly correlated with human judgments. ROUGE- 
			N is a n-gram recall measure calculated between 
			a candidate summary and a set of reference sum- 
			maries. In our experiments ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2 
			and ROUGE-SU4 will be computed. 
			3.3 Results 
			Table 1 reports the results obtained on the DUC 
			2007 update data set for different sentence scor- 
			ing methods. cosine + JWe stands for the scor- 
			ing method defined in (2) and NR improves it 
			with sentence re-ranking defined in equation (4). 
			SMMR is the combined adaptation we have pro- 
			posed in (5). The function f(H) used in SMMR is 
			the simple rational function 1 
			H 
			, where H increases 
			with the number of previous clusters (f(H) = 1 
			for cluster A, 1 
			2 
			for cluster B and 1 
			3 
			for cluster C). 
			This function allows to simply test the assumption 
			that non-redundancy have to be favoured as the 
			size of history grows. Baseline results are obtained 
			on summaries generated by taking the leading sen- 
			tences of the most recent documents of the cluster, 
			up to 100 words (official baseline of DUC). The 
			table also lists the three top performing systems at 
			DUC 2007 and the lowest scored human reference. 
			As we can see from these results, SMMR out- 
			performs the other sentence scoring methods. By 
			ways of comparison our system would have been 
			ranked second at the DUC 2007 update competi- 
			tion. Moreover, no post-processing was applied to 
			the selected sentences leaving an important margin 
			of progress. Another interesting result is the high 
			performance of the non-update specific method 
			(cosine + JWe) that could be due to the small size

			(10 documents), B (8 documents) and C (7 doc- 
			uments), the task is to create from the documents 
			three brief, fluent summaries that contribute to sat- 
			isfying the information need expressed in the topic 
			statement. 
			1. A summary of documents in cluster A. 
			2. An update summary of documents in B, un- 
			der the assumption that the reader has already 
			read documents in A. 
			2More information about the DUC 2007 corpus is avail- 
			able at http://duc.nist.gov/. 
			3. An update summary of documents in C, un- 
			der the assumption that the reader has already 
			read documents in A and B. 
			Within a topic, the document clusters must be pro- 
			cessed in chronological order. Our system gener- 
			ates a summary for each cluster by arranging the 
			high ranked sentences until the limit of 100 words 
			is reached. 
			3.2 Evaluation 
			Most existing automated evaluation methods work 
			by comparing the generated summaries to one or 
			more reference summaries (ideally, produced by 
			humans). To evaluate the quality of our generated 
			summaries, we choose to use the ROUGE3 (Lin, 
			2004) evaluation toolkit, that has been found to be 
			highly correlated with human judgments. ROUGE- 
			N is a n-gram recall measure calculated between 
			a candidate summary and a set of reference sum- 
			maries. In our experiments ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2 
			and ROUGE-SU4 will be computed. 
			3.3 Results 
			Table 1 reports the results obtained on the DUC 
			2007 update data set for different sentence scor- 
			ing methods. cosine + JWe stands for the scor- 
			ing method defined in (2) and NR improves it 
			with sentence re-ranking defined in equation (4). 
			SMMR is the combined adaptation we have pro- 
			posed in (5). The function f(H) used in SMMR is 
			the simple rational function 1 
			H 
			, where H increases 
			with the number of previous clusters (f(H) = 1 
			for cluster A, 1 
			2 
			for cluster B and 1 
			3 
			for cluster C). 
			This function allows to simply test the assumption 
			that non-redundancy have to be favoured as the 
			size of history grows. Baseline results are obtained 
			on summaries generated by taking the leading sen- 
			tences of the most recent documents of the cluster, 
			up to 100 words (official baseline of DUC). The 
			table also lists the three top performing systems at 
			DUC 2007 and the lowest scored human reference. 
			As we can see from these results, SMMR out- 
			performs the other sentence scoring methods. By 
			ways of comparison our system would have been 
			ranked second at the DUC 2007 update competi- 
			tion. Moreover, no post-processing was applied to 
			the selected sentences leaving an important margin 
			of progress. Another interesting result is the high 
			performance of the non-update specific method 
			(cosine + JWe) that could be due to the small size

			2 Single-Document Summarization 
			Usually, the flow of information in a given document is not uniform, which means 
			that some parts are more important than others. The major challenge in summa- 
			rization lies in distinguishing the more informative parts of a document from the 
			less ones. Though there have been instances of research describing the automatic 
			creation of abstracts, most work presented in the literature relies on verbatim ex- 
			traction of sentences to address the problem of single-document summarization. In

			this section, we describe some eminent extractive techniques. First, we look at early 
			work from the 1950s and 60s that kicked off research on summarization. Second, 
			we concentrate on approaches involving machine learning techniques published in 
			the 1990s to today. Finally, we briefly describe some techniques that use a more 
			complex natural language analysis to tackle the problem. 
			2.1 Early Work 
			Most early work on single-document summarization focused on technical documents. 
			Perhaps the most cited paper on summarization is that of (Luhn, 1958), that de- 
			scribes research done at IBM in the 1950s. In his work, Luhn proposed that the 
			frequency of a particular word in an article provides an useful measure of its sig- 
			nificance. There are several key ideas put forward in this paper that have assumed 
			importance in later work on summarization. As a first step, words were stemmed to 
			their root forms, and stop words were deleted. Luhn then compiled a list of content 
			words sorted by decreasing frequency, the index providing a significance measure of 
			the word. On a sentence level, a significance factor was derived that reflects the 
			number of occurrences of significant words within a sentence, and the linear distance 
			between them due to the intervention of non-significant words. All sentences are 
			ranked in order of their significance factor, and the top ranking sentences are finally 
			selected to form the auto-abstract. 
			Related work (Baxendale, 1958), also done at IBM and published in the same 
			journal, provides early insight on a particular feature helpful in finding salient parts 
			of documents: the sentence position. Towards this goal, the author examined 200 
			paragraphs to find that in 85% of the paragraphs the topic sentence came as the first 
			one and in 7% of the time it was the last sentence. Thus, a naive but fairly accurate 
			way to select a topic sentence would be to choose one of these two. This positional 
			feature has since been used in many complex machine learning based systems. 
			Edmundson (1969) describes a system that produces document extracts. His 
			primary contribution was the development of a typical structure for an extractive 
			summarization experiment. At first, the author developed a protocol for creating 
			manual extracts, that was applied in a set of 400 technical documents. The two 
			features of word frequency and positional importance were incorporated from the 
			previous two works. Two other features were used: the presence of cue words 
			(presence of words like significant, or hardly), and the skeleton of the document 
			(whether the sentence is a title or heading). Weights were attached to each of these 
			features manually to score each sentence. During evaluation, it was found that about 
			44% of the auto-extracts matched the manual extracts. 
			2.2 Machine Learning Methods 
			In the 1990s, with the advent of machine learning techniques in NLP, a series of semi- 
			nal publications appeared that employed statistical techniques to produce document 
			extracts. While initially most systems assumed feature independence and relied on 
			naive-Bayes methods, others have focused on the choice of appropriate features and 
			3 
			on learning algorithms that make no independence assumptions. Other significant 
			approaches involved hidden Markov models and log-linear models to improve ex- 
			tractive summarization. A very recent paper, in contrast, used neural networks and 
			third party features (like common words in search engine queries) to improve purely 
			extractive single document summarization. We next describe all these approaches 
			in more detail. 
			2.2.1 Naive-Bayes Methods 
			Kupiec et al. (1995) describe a method derived from Edmundson (1969) that is able 
			to learn from data. The classification function categorizes each sentence as worthy 
			of extraction or not, using a naive-Bayes classifier. Let s be a particular sentence, 
			S the set of sentences that make up the summary, and F1, . . . , Fk the features. 
			Assuming independence of the features: 
			P(s  S | F1, F2, ..Fk) = 
			k 
			i=1 
			P(Fi | s  S) * P(s  S) 
			k 
			i=1 
			P(Fi) 
			(1) 
			The features were compliant to (Edmundson, 1969), but additionally included the 
			sentence length and the presence of uppercase words. Each sentence was given a 
			score according to (1), and only the n top sentences were extracted. To evaluate 
			the system, a corpus of technical documents with manual abstracts was used in 
			the following way: for each sentence in the manual abstract, the authors manually 
			analyzed its match with the actual document sentences and created a mapping 
			(e.g. exact match with a sentence, matching a join of two sentences, not matchable, 
			etc.). The auto-extracts were then evaluated against this mapping. Feature analysis 
			revealed that a system using only the position and the cue features, along with the 
			sentence length sentence feature, performed best. 
			Aone et al. (1999) also incorporated a naive-Bayes classifier, but with richer 
			features. They describe a system called DimSum that made use of features like 
			term frequency (tf ) and inverse document frequency (idf) to derive signature words.4 
			The idf was computed from a large corpus of the same domain as the concerned 
			documents. Statistically derived two-noun word collocations were used as units for 
			counting, along with single words. A named-entity tagger was used and each entity 
			was considered as a single token. They also employed some shallow discourse analysis 
			like reference to same entities in the text, maintaining cohesion. The references 
			were resolved at a very shallow level by linking name aliases within a document 
			like "U.S." to "United States", or "IBM" for "International Business Machines". 
			Synonyms and morphological variants were also merged while considering lexical 
			terms, the former being identified by using Wordnet (Miller, 1995). The corpora 
			used in the experiments were from newswire, some of which belonged to the TREC 
			evaluations.

			2.2.2 Rich Features and Decision Trees 
			Lin and Hovy (1997) studied the importance of a single feature, sentence position. 
			Just weighing a sentence by its position in text, which the authors term as the 
			"position method", arises from the idea that texts generally follow a predictable 
			discourse structure, and that the sentences of greater topic centrality tend to occur in 
			certain specifiable locations (e.g. title, abstracts, etc). However, since the discourse 
			structure significantly varies over domains, the position method cannot be defined 
			as naively as in (Baxendale, 1958). The paper makes an important contribution by 
			investigating techniques of tailoring the position method towards optimality over a 
			genre and how it can be evaluated for effectiveness. A newswire corpus was used, the 
			collection of Ziff-Davis texts produced from the TIPSTER5 program; it consists of 
			text about computer and related hardware, accompanied by a set of key topic words 
			and a small abstract of six sentences. For each document in the corpus, the authors 
			measured the yield of each sentence position against the topic keywords. They then 
			ranked the sentence positions by their average yield to produce the Optimal Position 
			Policy (OPP) for topic positions for the genre. 
			Two kinds of evaluation were performed. Previously unseen text was used for 
			testing whether the same procedure would work in a different domain. The first 
			evaluation showed contours exactly like the training documents. In the second eval- 
			uation, word overlap of manual abstracts with the extracted sentences was measured. 
			Windows in abstracts were compared with windows on the selected sentences and 
			corresponding precision and recall values were measured. A high degree of coverage 
			indicated the effectiveness of the position method. 
			In later work, Lin (1999) broke away from the assumption that features are 
			independent of each other and tried to model the problem of sentence extraction 
			using decision trees, instead of a naive-Bayes classifier. He examined a lot of fea- 
			tures and their effect on sentence extraction. The data used in this work is a 
			publicly available collection of texts, classified into various topics, provided by the 
			TIPSTER-SUMMAC6 evaluations, targeted towards information retrieval systems. 
			The dataset contains essential text fragments (phrases, clauses, and sentences) which 
			must be included in summaries to answer some TREC topics. These fragments were 
			each evaluated by a human judge. The experiments described in the paper are with 
			the SUMMARIST system developed at the University of Southern California. The 
			system extracted sentences from the documents and those were matched against 
			human extracts, like most early work on extractive summarization. 
			Some novel features were the query signature (normalized score given to sen- 
			tences depending on number of query words that they contain), IR signature (the 
			m most salient words in the corpus, similar to the signature words of (Aone et al., 
			1999)), numerical data (boolean value 1 given to sentences that contained a num- 
			ber in them), proper name (boolean value 1 given to sentences that contained a 
			proper name in them), pronoun or adjective (boolean value 1 given to sentences 
			5See http://www.itl.nist.gov/iaui/894.02/related_projects/tipster/. 
			6See http://www-nlpir.nist.gov/related_projects/tipster_summac/index.html. 
			5 
			that contained a pronoun or adjective in them), weekday or month (similar as pre- 
			vious feature) and quotation (similar as previous feature). It is worth noting that 
			some features like the query signature are question-oriented because of the setting 
			of the evaluation, unlike a generalized summarization framework. 
			The author experimented with various baselines, like using only the positional 
			feature, or using a simple combination of all features by adding their values. When 
			evaluated by matching machine extracted and human extracted sentences, the deci- 
			sion tree classifier was clearly the winner for the whole dataset, but for three topics, 
			a naive combination of features beat it. Lin conjectured that this happened because 
			some of the features were independent of each other. Feature analysis suggested 
			that the IR signature was a valuable feature, corroborating the early findings of 
			Luhn (1958). 
			2.2.3 Hidden Markov Models 
			In contrast with previous approaches, that were mostly feature-based and non- 
			sequential, Conroy and O'leary (2001) modeled the problem of extracting a sentence 
			from a document using a hidden Markov model (HMM). The basic motivation for 
			using a sequential model is to account for local dependencies between sentences. 
			Only three features were used: position of the sentence in the document (built into 
			the state structure of the HMM), number of terms in the sentence, and likeliness of 
			the sentence terms given the document terms.

			Figure 1: Markov model to extract to three summary sentences from a document 
			(Conroy and O'leary, 2001). 
			The HMM was structured as follows: it contained 2s + 1 states, alternating be- 
			tween s summary states and s+1 nonsummary states. The authors allowed "hesita- 
			tion" only in nonsummary states and "skipping next state" only in summary states. 
			Figure 1 shows an example HMM with 7 nodes, corresponding to s = 3. Using the 
			TREC dataset as training corpus, the authors obtained the maximum-likelihood 
			estimate for each transition probability, forming the transition matrix estimate  
			M, 
			whose element (i, j) is the empirical probability of transitioning from state i to j. 
			Associated with each state i was an output function, bi(O) = Pr(O | state i) where 
			O is an observed vector of features. They made a simplifying assumption that the 
			features are multivariate normal. The output function for each state was thus esti- 
			mated by using the training data to compute the maximum likelihood estimate of 
			its mean and covariance matrix. They estimated 2s+1 means, but assumed that all 
			of the output functions shared a common covariance matrix. Evaluation was done 
			6 
			by comparing with human generated extracts. 
			2.2.4 Log-Linear Models 
			Osborne (2002) claims that existing approaches to summarization have always as- 
			sumed feature independence. The author used log-linear models to obviate this 
			assumption and showed empirically that the system produced better extracts than 
			a naive-Bayes model, with a prior appended to both models. Let c be a label, s 
			the item we are interested in labeling, fi the i-th feature, and i the corresponding 
			feature weight. The conditional log-linear model used by Osborne (2002) can be 
			stated as follows: 
			P(c | s) = 
			1 
			Z(s) 
			exp 
			i 
			ifi(c, s) , (2) 
			where Z(s) = c 
			exp ( i 
			ifi(c, s)). In this domain, there are only two possible 
			labels: either the sentence is to be extracted or it is not. The weights were trained 
			by conjugate gradient descent. The authors added a non-uniform prior to the model, 
			claiming that a log-linear model tends to reject too many sentences for inclusion in 
			a summary. The same prior was also added to a naive-Bayes model for comparison. 
			The classification took place as follows: 
			label(s) = arg max 
			cC 
			P(c) * P(s, c) = arg max 
			cC 
			log P(c) + 
			i 
			ifi(c, s) . (3) 
			The authors optimized the prior using the f2 score of the classifier as an objective 
			function on a part of the dataset (in the technical domain). The summaries were 
			evaluated using the standard f2 score where f2 = 2pr 
			p+r 
			, where the precision and recall 
			measures were measured against human generated extracts. The features included 
			word pairs (pairs of words with all words truncated to ten characters), sentence 
			length, sentence position, and naive discourse features like inside introduction or 
			inside conclusion. With respect to f2 score, the log-linear model outperformed the 
			naive-Bayes classifier with the prior, exhibiting the former's effectiveness. 
			2.2.5 Neural Networks and Third Party Features 
			In 2001-02, DUC issued a task of creating a 100-word summary of a single news 
			article. However, the best performing systems in the evaluations could not outper- 
			form the baseline with statistical significance. This extremely strong baseline has 
			been analyzed by Nenkova (2005) and corresponds to the selection of the first n 
			sentences of a newswire article. This surprising result has been attributed to the 
			journalistic convention of putting the most important part of an article in the initial 
			paragraphs. After 2002, the task of single-document summarization for newswire 
			was dropped from DUC. Svore et al. (2007) propose an algorithm based on neu- 
			ral nets and the use of third party datasets to tackle the problem of extractive 
			summarization, outperforming the baseline with statistical significance. 
			7 
			The authors used a dataset containing 1365 documents gathered from CNN.com, 
			each consisting of the title, timestamp, three or four human generated story high- 
			lights and the article text. They considered the task of creating three machine 
			highlights. The human generated highlights were not verbatim extractions from the 
			article itself. The authors evaluated their system using two metrics: the first one 
			concatenated the three highlights produced by the system, concatenated the three 
			human generated highlights, and compared these two blocks; the second metric con- 
			sidered the ordering and compared the sentences on an individual level. 
			Svore et al. (2007) trained a model from the labels and the features for each 
			sentence of an article, that could infer the proper ranking of sentences in a test 
			document. The ranking was accomplished using RankNet (Burges et al., 2005), a 
			pair-based neural network algorithm designed to rank a set of inputs that uses the 
			gradient descent method for training. For the training set, they used ROUGE-1 
			(Lin, 2004) to score the similarity of a human written highlight and a sentence 
			in the document. These similarity scores were used as soft labels during training, 
			contrasting with other approaches where sentences are "hard-labeled", as selected 
			or not. 
			Some of the used features based on position or n-grams frequencies have been 
			observed in previous work. However, the novelty of the framework lay in the use 
			of features that derived information from query logs from Microsoft's news search 
			engine7 and Wikipedia8 entries. The authors conjecture that if a document sentence 
			contained keywords used in the news search engine, or entities found in Wikipedia 
			articles, then there is a greater chance of having that sentence in the highlight. The 
			extracts were evaluated using ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2, and showed statistically 
			significant improvements over the baseline of selecting the first three sentences in a 
			document. 
			2.3 Deep Natural Language Analysis Methods 
			In this subsection, we describe a set of papers that detail approaches towards single- 
			document summarization involving complex natural language analysis techniques. 
			None of these papers solve the problem using machine learning, but rather use a set 
			of heuristics to create document extracts. Most of these techniques try to model the 
			text's discourse structure. 
			Barzilay and Elhadad (1997) describe a work that used considerable amount of 
			linguistic analysis for performing the task of summarization. For a better under- 
			standing of their method, we need to define a lexical chain: it is a sequence of related 
			words in a text, spanning short (adjacent words or sentences) or long distances (en- 
			tire text). The authors' method progressed with the following steps: segmentation 
			of the text, identification of lexical chains, and using strong lexical chains to identify 
			the sentences worthy of extraction. They tried to reach a middle ground between 
			(McKeown and Radev, 1995) and (Luhn, 1958) where the former relied on deep 
			7See http://search.live.com/news. 
			8See http://en.wikipedia.org. 
			8 
			semantic structure of the text, while the latter relied on word statistics of the doc- 
			uments. The authors describe the notion of cohesion in text as a means of sticking 
			together different parts of the text. Lexical cohesion is a notable example where 
			semantically related words are used. For example, let us take a look at the following 
			sentence.9 
			John bought a Jag. He loves the car. (4) 
			Here, the word car refers to the word Jag in the previous sentence, and exemplifies 
			lexical cohesion. The phenomenon of cohesion occurs not only at the word level, 
			but at word sequences too, resulting in lexical chains, which the authors used as 
			a source representation for summarization. Semantically related words and word 
			sequences were identified in the document, and several chains were extracted, that 
			form a representation of the document. To find out lexical chains, the authors used 
			Wordnet (Miller, 1995), applying three generic steps: 
			1. Selecting a set of candidate words. 
			2. For each candidate word, finding an appropriate chain relying on a relatedness 
			criterion among members of the chains, 
			3. If it is found, inserting the word in the chain and updating it accordingly. 
			The relatedness was measured in terms of Wordnet distance. Simple nouns and 
			noun compounds were used as starting point to find the set of candidates. In the 
			final steps, strong lexical chains were used to create the summaries. The chains were 
			scored by their length and homogeneity. Then the authors used a few heuristics to 
			select the significant sentences. 
			In another paper, Ono et al. (1994) put forward a computational model of dis- 
			course for Japanese expository writings, where they elaborate a practical procedure 
			for extracting the discourse rhetorical structure, a binary tree representing relations 
			between chunks of sentences (rhetorical structure trees are used more intensively in 
			(Marcu, 1998a), as we will see below). This structure was extracted using a series 
			of NLP steps: sentence analysis, rhetorical relation extraction, segmentation, can- 
			didate generation and preference judgement. Evaluation was based on the relative 
			importance of rhetorical relations. In the following step, the nodes of the rhetori- 
			cal structure tree were pruned to reduce the sentence, keeping its important parts. 
			Same was done for paragraphs to finally produce the summary. Evaluation was done 
			with respect to sentence coverage and 30 editorial articles of a Japanese newspaper 
			were used as the dataset. The articles had corresponding sets of key sentences and 
			most important key sentences judged by human subjects. The key sentence coverage 
			was about 51% and the most important key sentence coverage was 74%, indicating 
			encouraging results. 
			Marcu (1998a) describes a unique approach towards summarization that, unlike 
			most other previous work, does not assume that the sentences in a document form 
			a flat sequence. This paper used discourse based heuristics with the traditional 
			9Example from http://www.cs.ucd.ie/staff/jcarthy/home/Lex.html. 
			9 
			features that have been used in the summarization literature. The discourse theory 
			used in this paper is the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) that holds between 
			two non-overlapping pieces of text spans: the nucleus and the satellite. The author 
			mentions that the distinction between nuclei and satellites comes from the empir- 
			ical observation that the nucleus expresses what is more essential to the writer's 
			purpose than the satellite; and that the nucleus of a rhetorical relation is compre- 
			hensible independent of the satellite, but not vice versa. Marcu (1998b) describes 
			the details of a rhetorical parser producing a discourse tree. Figure 2 shows an 
			example discourse tree for a text example detailed in the paper. Once such a dis-

			Figure 2: Example of a discourse tree from Marcu (1998a). The numbers in the 
			nodes denote sentence numbers from the text example. The text below the number 
			in selected nodes are rhetorical relations. The dotted nodes are SATELLITES and 
			the normals ones are the NUCLEI. 
			course structure is created, a partial ordering of important units can be developed 
			from the tree. Each equivalence class in the partial ordering is derived from the 
			new sentences at a particular level of the discourse tree. In Figure 2, we observe 
			that sentence 2 is at the root, followed by sentence 8 in the second level. In the 
			third level, sentence 3 and 10 are observed, and so forth. The equivalence classes 
			are 2 > 8 > 3, 10 > 1, 4, 5, 7, 9 > 6. 
			If it is specified that the summary should contain the top k% of the text, the first 
			k% of the units in the partial ordering can be selected to produce the summary. The 
			author talks about a summarization system based just on this method in (Marcu, 
			1998b) and in one of his earlier papers. In this paper, he merged the discourse 
			based heuristics with traditional heuristics. The metrics used were clustering based 
			10 
			metric (each node in the discourse tree was assigned a cluster score; for leaves the 
			score was 0, for the internal nodes it was given by the similarity of the immediate 
			children; discourse tree A was chosen to be better than B if its clustering score 
			was higher), marker based metric (a discourse structure A was chosen to be better 
			than a discourse structure B if A used more rhetorical relations than B), rhetorical 
			clustering based technique (measured the similarity between salient units of two text 
			spans), shape based metric (preferred a discourse tree A over B if A was more skewed 
			towards the right than B), title based metric, position based metric, connectedness 
			based metric (cosine similarity of an unit to all other text units, a discourse structure 
			A was chosen to be better than B if its connectedness measure was more than B). 
			A weighted linear combination of all these scores gave the score of a discourse 
			structure. To find the best combination of heuristics, the author computed the 
			weights that maximized the F-score on the training dataset, which was constituted 
			by newswire articles. To do this, he used a GSAT-like algorithm (Selman et al., 
			1992) that performed a greedy search in a seven dimensional space of the metrics. 
			For a part of his corpus (the TREC dataset), a best F-score of 75.42% was achieved 
			for the 10% summaries which was 3.5% higher than a baseline lead based algorithm, 
			which was very encouraging. 
			3 Multi-Document Summarization 
			Extraction of a single summary from multiple documents has gained interest since 
			mid 1990s, most applications being in the domain of news articles. Several Web- 
			based news clustering systems were inspired by research on multi-document summa- 
			rization, for example Google News,10 Columbia NewsBlaster,11 or News In Essence.12 
			This departs from single-document summarization since the problem involves mul- 
			tiple sources of information that overlap and supplement each other, being contra- 
			dictory at occasions. So the key tasks are not only identifying and coping with 
			redundancy across documents, but also recognizing novelty and ensuring that the 
			final summary is both coherent and complete. 
			The field seems to have been pioneered by the NLP group at Columbia University 
			(McKeown and Radev, 1995), where a summarization system called SUMMONS13 
			was developed by extending already existing technology for template-driven message 
			understanding systems. Although in that early stage multi-document summariza- 
			tion was mainly seen as a task requiring substantial capabilities of both language 
			interpretation and generation, it later gained autonomy, as people coming from dif- 
			ferent communities added new perspectives to the problem. Extractive techniques 
			have been applied, making use of similarity measures between pairs of sentences. 
			Approaches vary on how these similarities are used: some identify common themes 
			through clustering and then select one sentence to represent each cluster (McKeown

			et al., 1999; Radev et al., 2000), others generate a composite sentence from each 
			cluster (Barzilay et al., 1999), while some approaches work dynamically by includ- 
			ing each candidate passage only if it is considered novel with respect to the previous 
			included passages, via maximal marginal relevance (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998). 
			Some recent work extends multi-document summarization to multilingual environ- 
			ments (Evans, 2005). 
			The way the problem is posed has also varied over time. While in some pub- 
			lications it is claimed that extractive techniques would not be effective for multi- 
			document summarization (McKeown and Radev, 1995; McKeown et al., 1999), some 
			years later that claim was overturned, as extractive systems like MEAD14 (Radev 
			et al., 2000) achieved good performance in large scale summarization of news arti- 
			cles. This can be explained by the fact that summarization systems often distinguish 
			among themselves about what their goal actually is. While some systems, like SUM- 
			MONS, are designed to work in strict domains, aiming to build a sort of briefing 
			that highlights differences and updates accross different news reports, putting much 
			emphasis on how information is presented to the user, others, like MEAD, are large 
			scale systems that intend to work in general domains, being more concerned with 
			information content rather than form. Consequently, systems of the former kind re- 
			quire a strong effort on language generation to produce a grammatical and coherent 
			summary, while latter systems are probably more close to the information retrieval 
			paradigm. Abstractive systems like SUMMONS are difficult to replicate, as they 
			heavily rely on the adaptation of internal tools to perform information extraction 
			and language generation. On the other hand, extractive systems are generally easy 
			to implement from scratch, and this makes them appealing when sophisticated NLP 
			tools are not available. 
			3.1 Abstraction and Information Fusion 
			As far as we know, SUMMONS (McKeown and Radev, 1995; Radev and McKeown, 
			1998) is the first historical example of a multi-document summarization system. It 
			tackles single events about a narrow domain (news articles about terrorism) and 
			produces a briefing merging relevant information about each event and how reports 
			by different news agencies have evolved over time. The whole thread of reports is 
			then presented, as illustrated in the following example of a "good" summary: 
			"In the afternoon of February 26, 1993, Reuters reported that a suspect 
			bomb killed at least five people in the World Trade Center. However, 
			Associated Press announced that exactly five people were killed in the 
			blast. Finally, Associated Press announced that Arab terrorists were 
			possibly responsible for the terrorist act." 
			Rather than working with raw text, SUMMONS reads a database previously 
			built by a template-based message understanding system. A full multi-document

			summarizer is built by concatenating the two systems, first processing full text as 
			input and filling template slots, and then synthesizing a summary from the extracted 
			information. The architecture of SUMMONS consists of two major components: a 
			content planner that selects the information to include in the summary through 
			combination of the input templates, and a linguistic generator that selects the right 
			words to express the information in grammatical and coherent text. The latter 
			component was devised by adapting existing language generation tools, namely the 
			FUF/SURGE system15. Content planning, on the other hand, is made through 
			summary operators, a set of heuristic rules that perform operations like "change of 
			perspective", "contradiction", "refinement", etc. Some of these operations require 
			resolving conflicts, i.e., contradictory information among different sources or time 
			instants; others complete pieces of information that are included in some articles 
			and not in others, combining them into a single template. At the end, the linguis- 
			tic generator gathers all the combined information and uses connective phrases to 
			synthesize a summary. 
			While this framework seems promising when the domain is narrow enough so that 
			the templates can be designed by hand, a generalization for broader domains would 
			be problematic. This was improved later by McKeown et al. (1999) and Barzilay 
			et al. (1999), where the input is now a set of related documents in raw text, like 
			those retrieved by a standard search engine in response to a query. The system starts 
			by identifying themes, i.e., sets of similar text units (usually paragraphs). This is 
			formulated as a clustering problem. To compute a similarity measure between text 
			units, these are mapped to vectors of features, that include single words weighted 
			by their TF-IDF scores, noun phrases, proper nouns, synsets from the Wordnet 
			database and a database of semantic classes of verbs. For each pair of paragraphs, a 
			vector is computed that represents matches on the different features. Decision rules 
			that were learned from data are then used to classify each pair of text units either 
			as similar or dissimilar; this in turn feeds a subsequent algorithm that places the 
			most related paragraphs in the same theme. 
			Once themes are identified, the system enters its second stage: information fu- 
			sion. The goal is to decide which sentences of a theme should be included in the 
			summary. Rather than just picking a sentence that is a group representative, the 
			authors propose an algorithm which compares and intersects predicate argument 
			structures of the phrases within each theme to determine which are repeated often 
			enough to be included in the summary. This is done as follows: first, sentences are 
			parsed through Collins' statistical parser (Collins, 1999) and converted into depen- 
			dency trees, which allows capturing the predicate-argument structure and identify 
			functional roles. Determiners and auxiliaries are dropped; Fig. 3 shows a sentence 
			representation. 
			The comparison algorithm then traverses these dependency trees recursively, 
			adding identical nodes to the output tree. Once full phrases (a verb with at least 
			two constituents) are found, they are marked to be included in the summary. If two 
			15FUF, SURGE, and other tools developed by the Columbia NLP group are available at

			13 
			and Kan 1998]. We match two verbs that share the same 
			semantic class in this classifi cation. 
			In addition to the above primitive features that all com- 
			pare single items from each text unit, we use composite fea- 
			tures that combine pairs of primitive features. Our compos- 
			ite features impose particular constraints on the order of the 
			two elements in the pair, on the maximum distance between 
			the two elements, and on the syntactic classes that the two 
			elements come from. They can vary from a simple com- 
			bination (e.g., "two text units must share two words to be 
			similar") to complex cases with many conditions (e.g., "two 
			text units must have matching noun phrases that appear in 
			the same order and with relative difference in position no 
			more than fi ve"). In this manner, we capture information 
			on how similarly related elements are spaced out in the two 
			text units, as well as syntactic information on word combi- 
			nations. Matches on composite features indicate combined 
			evidence for the similarity of the two units. 
			To determine whether the units match overall, we employ 
			a machine learning algorithm [Cohen 1996] that induces de- 
			cision rules using the features that really make a difference. 
			A set of pairs of units already marked as similar or not by a 
			human is used for training the classifi er. We have manually 
			marked a set of 8,225 paragraph comparisons from the TDT 
			corpus for training and evaluating our similarity classifi er. 
			For comparison, we also use an implementation of the 
			TF*IDF method which is standard for matching texts in in- 
			formation retrieval. We compute the total frequency (TF) of 
			words in each text unit and the number of units in our train- 
			ing set each word appears in (DF, or document frequency). 
			Then each text unit is represented as a vector of TF*IDF 
			scores, calculated as 
			TF(wordi 
			) * log Total number of units 
			DF(wordi 
			) 
			Similarity between text units is measured by the cosine of 
			the angle between the corresponding two vectors (i.e., the 
			normalized inner product of the two vectors), and the opti- 
			mal value of a threshold for judging two units as similar is 
			computed from the training set. 
			After all pairwise similarities between text units have 
			been calculated, we utilize a clustering algorithm to iden- 
			tify themes. As a paragraph may belong to multiple themes, 
			most standard clustering algorithms, which partition their 
			input set, are not suitable for our task. We use a greedy, 
			one-pass algorithm that fi rst constructs groups from the most 
			similar paragraphs, seeding the groups with the fully con- 
			nected subcomponents of the graph that the similarity rela- 
			tionship induces over the set of paragraphs, and then places 
			additional paragraphs within a group if the fraction of the 
			members of the group they are similar to exceeds a preset 
			threshold. 
			Language Generation 
			Given a group of similar paragraphs--a theme--the prob- 
			lem is to create a concise and fluent fusion of information in 
			this theme, reflecting facts common to all paragraphs. A 
			straightforward method would be to pick a representative 
			subject

			sentence that meets some criteria (e.g., a threshold number 
			of common content words). In practice, however, any repre- 
			sentative sentence will usually include embedded phrase(s) 
			containing information that is not common to all sentences 
			in the theme. Furthermore, other sentences in the theme of- 
			ten contain additional information not presented in the rep- 
			resentative sentence. Our approach, therefore, uses inter- 
			section among theme sentences to identify phrases common 
			to most paragraphs and then generates a new sentence from 
			identifi ed phrases. 
			Intersection among Theme Sentences 
			Intersection is carried out in the content planner, which uses 
			a parser for interpreting the input sentences, with our new 
			work focusing on the comparison of phrases. Theme sen- 
			tences are fi rst run through a statistical parser[Collins 1996] 
			and then, in order to identify functional roles (e.g., subject, 
			object), are converted to a dependency grammar representa- 
			tion [Kittredge and Mel' 
			cuk 1983], which makes predicate- 
			argument structure explicit. 
			We developed a rule-based component to produce func- 
			tional roles, which transforms the phrase-structure output of 
			Collins' parser to dependency grammar; function words (de- 
			terminers and auxiliaries) are eliminated from the tree and 
			corresponding syntactic features are updated. An example 
			of a theme sentence and its dependency grammar represen- 
			tation are shown in Figure 4. Each non-auxiliary word in the 
			sentence has a node in the representation, and this node is 
			connected to its direct dependents. 
			The comparison algorithm starts with all subtrees rooted 
			at verbs from the input dependency structure, and traverses 
			them recursively: if two nodes are identical, they are added 
			to the output tree, and their children are compared. Once 
			a full phrase (verb with at least two constituents) has been 
			found, it is confi rmed for inclusion in the summary. 
			Diffi culties arise when two nodes are not identical, but are 
			similar. Such phrases may be paraphrases of each other and 
			still convey essentially the same information. Since theme 
			sentences are a priori close semantically, this signifi cantly 
			Figure 3: Dependency tree representing the sentence "McVeigh, 27, was charged 
			with the bombing" (extracted from (McKeown et al., 1999)). 
			phrases, rooted at some node, are not identical but yet similar, the hypothesis that 
			they are paraphrases of each other is considered; to take this into account, corpus- 
			driven paraphrasing rules are written to allow paraphrase intersection.16 Once the 
			summary content (represented as predicate-argument structures) is decided, a gram- 
			matical text is generated by translating those structures into the arguments expected 
			by the FUF/SURGE language generation system. 
			3.2 Topic-driven Summarization and MMR 
			Carbonell and Goldstein (1998) made a major contribution to topic-driven sum- 
			marization by introducing the maximal marginal relevance (MMR) measure. The 
			idea is to combine query relevance with information novelty; it may be applicable 
			in several tasks ranging from text retrieval to topic-driven summarization. MMR 
			simultaneously rewards relevant sentences and penalizes redundant ones by consid- 
			ering a linear combination of two similarity measures. 
			Let Q be a query or user profile and R a ranked list of documents retrieved by 
			a search engine. Consider an incremental procedure that selects documents, one at 
			a time, and adds them to a set S. So let S be the set of already selected documents 
			in a particular step, and R \ S the set of yet unselected documents in R. For each 
			candidate document Di  R \ S, its marginal relevance MR(Di) is computed as: 
			MR(Di) := Sim1(Di, Q) - (1 - ) max 
			DjS 
			Sim2(Di, Dj) (5) 
			where  is a parameter lying in [0, 1] that controls the relative importance given 
			to relevance versus redundancy. Sim1 and Sim2 are two similarity measures; in the 
			16A full description of the kind of paraphrasing rules used can be found in (Barzilay et al., 
			1999). Examples are: ordering of sentence components, main clause vs. relative clause, realization 
			in different syntactic categories (e.g. classifier vs. apposition), change in grammatical features 
			(active/passive, time, number, etc.), head omission, transformation from one POS to another, 
			using semantically related words (e.g. synonyms), etc. 
			14 
			experiments both were set to the standard cosine similarity traditionally used in the 
			vector space model, Sim1(x, y) = Sim2(x, y) = x,y 
			x * y 
			. The document achieving the 
			highest marginal relevance, DMMR = arg maxDiR\S 
			MR(Di), is then selected, i.e., 
			added to S, and the procedure continues until a maximum number of documents 
			are selected or a minimum relevance threshold is attained. Carbonell and Goldstein 
			(1998) found experimentally that choosing dynamically the value of  turns out to be 
			more effective than keeping it fixed, namely starting with small values (  0.3) to 
			give more emphasis to novelty, and then increasing it (  0.7) to focus on the most 
			relevant documents. To perform summarization, documents can be first segmented 
			into sentences or paragraphs, and after a query is submitted, the MMR algorithm 
			can be applied followed by a selection of the top ranking passages, reordering them as 
			they appeared in the original documents, and presenting the result as the summary. 
			One of the attractive points in using MMR for summarization is its topic-oriented 
			feature, through its dependency on the query Q, which makes it particularly ap- 
			pealing to generate summaries according to a user profile: as the authors claim, "a 
			different user with different information needs may require a totally different sum- 
			mary of the same document." This assertion was not being taken into account by 
			previous multi-document summarization systems. 
			3.3 Graph Spreading Activation 
			Mani and Bloedorn (1997) describe an information extraction framework for sum- 
			marization, a graph-based method to find similarities and dissimilarities in pairs 
			of documents. Albeit no textual summary is generated, the summary content is 
			represented via entities (concepts) and relations that are displayed respectively as 
			nodes and edges of a graph. Rather than extracting sentences, they detect salient 
			regions of the graph via a spreading activation technique.17 
			This approach shares with the method described in Section 3.2 the property 
			of being topic-driven; there is an additional input that stands for the topic with 
			respect to which the summary is to be generated. The topic is represented through 
			a set of entry nodes in the graph. A document is represented as a graph as follows: 
			each node represents the occurrence of a single word (i.e., one word together with 
			its position in the text). Each node can have several kinds of links: adjacency 
			links (ADJ) to adjacent words in the text, SAME links to other occurrences of the 
			same word, and ALPHA links encoding semantic relationships captured through 
			Wordnet and NetOwl18. Besides these, PHRASE links tie together sequences of 
			adjacent nodes which belong to the same phrase, and NAME and COREF links 
			stand for co-referential name occurrences; Fig. 4 shows some of these links. 
			Once the graph is built, topic nodes are identified by stem comparison and be- 
			come the entry nodes. A search for semantically related text is then propagated from 
			these to the other nodes of the graph, in a process called spreading activation. Salient 
			17The name "spreading activation" is borrowed from a method used in information retrieval 
			(Salton and Buckley, 1988) to expand the search vocabulary.

			words and phrases are initialized according to their TF-IDF score. The weight of 
			neighboring nodes depends on the node link traveled and is an exponentially decay- 
			ing function of the distance of the traversed path. Traveling within a sentence is 
			made cheaper than across sentence boundaries, which in turn is cheaper than across 
			paragraph boundaries. Given a pair of document graphs, common nodes are identi- 
			fied either by sharing the same stem or by being synonyms. Analogously, difference 
			nodes are those that are not common. For each sentence in both documents, two 
			scores are computed: one score that reflects the presence of common nodes, which 
			is computed as the average weight of these nodes; and another score that computes 
			instead the average weights of difference nodes. Both scores are computed after 
			spreading activation. In the end, the sentences that have higher common and dif- 
			ferent scores are highlighted, the user being able to specify the maximal number of 
			common and different sentences to control the output. In the future, the authors 
			expect to use these structure to actually compose abstractive summaries, rather 
			than just highlighting pieces of text. 
			3.4 Centroid-based Summarization 
			Although clustering techniques were already being employed by McKeown et al. 
			(1999) and Barzilay et al. (1999) for identification of themes, Radev et al. (2000) 
			pioneered the use of cluster centroids to play a central role in summarization. A full 
			description of the centroid-based approach that underlies the MEAD system can 
			be found in (Radev et al., 2004); here we sketch briefly the main points. Perhaps 
			the most appealing feature is the fact that it does not make use of any language 
			generation module, unlike most previous systems. All documents are modeled as 
			bags-of-words. The system is also easily scalable and domain-independent. 
			The first stage consists of topic detection, whose goal is to group together news 
			articles that describe the same event. To accomplish this task, an agglomerative 
			clustering algorithm is used that operates over the TF-IDF vector representations 
			of the documents, successively adding documents to clusters and recomputing the 
			16 
			centroids according to 
			cj = dCj 
			 
			d 
			|Cj| 
			(6) 
			where cj is the centroid of the j-th cluster, Cj is the set of documents that belong 
			to that cluster, its cardinality being |Cj|, and  
			d is a "truncated version" of d that 
			vanishes on those words whose TF-IDF scores are below a threshold. Centroids 
			can thus be regarded as pseudo-documents that include those words whose TF- 
			IDF scores are above a threshold in the documents that constitute the cluster. Each 
			event cluster is a collection of (typically 2 to 10) news articles from multiple sources, 
			chronologically ordered, describing an event as it develops over time. 
			The second stage uses the centroids to identify sentences in each cluster that 
			are central to the topic of the entire cluster. In (Radev et al., 2000), two metrics 
			are defined that resemble the two summands in the MMR (see Section 3.2): cluster- 
			based relative utility (CBRU) and cross-sentence informational subsumption (CSIS). 
			The first accounts for how relevant a particular sentence is to the general topic of 
			the entire cluster; the second is a measure of redundancy among sentences. Unlike 
			MMR, these metrics are not query-dependent. Given one cluster C of documents 
			segmented into n sentences, and a compression rate R, a sequence of nR sentences 
			are extracted in the same order as they appear in the original documents, which in 
			turn are ordered chronologically. The selection of the sentences is made by approx- 
			imating their CBRU and CSIS.19 For each sentence si, three different features are 
			used: 
			* Its centroid value (Ci), defined as the sum of the centroid values of all the 
			words in the sentence, 
			* A positional value (Pi), that is used to make leading sentences more important. 
			Let Cmax be the centroid value of the highest ranked sentence in the document. 
			Then Pi = n-i+1 
			n 
			Cmax. 
			* The first-sentence overlap (Fi), defined as the inner product between the word 
			occurrence vector of sentence i and that of the first sentence of the document. 
			The final score of each sentence is a combination of the three scores above minus a 
			redundancy penalty (Rs) for each sentence that overlaps highly ranked sentences. 
			3.5 Multilingual Multi-document Summarization 
			Evans (2005) addresses the task of summarizing documents written in multiple 
			languages; this had already been sketched by Hovy and Lin (1999). Multilingual 
			summarization is still at an early stage, but this framework looks quite useful for 
			newswire applications that need to combine information from foreign news agen- 
			cies. Evans (2005) considered the scenario where there is a preferred language in 
			which the summary is to be written, and multiple documents in the preferred and 
			19The two metrics are used directly for evaluation (see (Radev et al., 2004) for more details). 
			17 
			in foreign languages are available. In their experiments, the preferred language was 
			English and the documents are news articles in English and Arabic. The rationale is 
			to summarize the English articles without discarding the information contained in 
			the Arabic documents. The IBM's statistical machine translation system is first ap- 
			plied to translate the Arabic documents to English. Then a search is made, for each 
			translated text unit, to see whether there is a similar sentence or not in the English 
			documents. If so, and if the sentence is found relevant enough to be included in the 
			summary, the similar English sentence is included instead of the Arabic-to-English 
			translation. This way, the final summary is more likely to be grammatical, since 
			machine translation is known to be far from perfect. On the other hand, the result 
			is also expected to have higher coverage than using just the English documents, 
			since the information contained in the Arabic documents can help to decide about 
			the relevance of each sentence. In order to measure similarity between sentences, a 
			tool named SimFinder20 was employed: this is a tool for clustering text based on 
			similarity over a variety of lexical and syntactic features using a log-linear regression 
			model. 
			4 Other Approaches to Summarization 
			This section describes briefly some unconventional approaches that, rather than 
			aiming to build full summarization systems, investigate some details that underlie 
			the summarization process, and that we conjecture to have a role to play in future 
			research on this field. 
			4.1 Short Summaries 
			Witbrock and Mittal (1999) claim that extractive summarization is not very pow- 
			erful in that the extracts are not concise enough when very short summaries are 
			required. They present a system that generated headline style summaries. The cor- 
			pus used in this work was newswire articles from Reuters and the Associated Press, 
			publicly available at the LDC21. The system learned statistical models of the rela- 
			tionship between source text units and headline units. It attempted to model both 
			the order and the likelihood of the appearance of tokens in the target documents. 
			Both the models, one for content selection and the other for surface realization were 
			used to co-constrain each other during the search in the summary generation task. 
			For content selection, the model learned a translation model between a docu- 
			ment and its summary (Brown et al., 1993). This model in the simplest case can be 
			thought as a mapping between a word in the document and the likelihood of some 
			word appearing in the summary. To simplify the model, the authors assumed that 
			the probability of a word appearing in a summary is independent of its structure. 
			This mapping boils down to the fact that the probability of a particular summary 
			20See http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/nlp/tools.cgi#SimFinder. 
			21See http://ldc.upenn.edu. 
			18 
			candidate is the product of the probabilities of the summary content and that con- 
			tent being expressed using a particular structure. 
			The surface realization model used was a bigram model. Viterbi beam search 
			was used to efficiently find a near-optimal summary. The Markov assumption was 
			violated by using backtracking at every state to strongly discourage paths that 
			repeated terms, since bigrams that start repeating often seem to pathologically 
			overwhelm the search otherwise. To evaluate the system, the authors compared 
			its output against the actual headlines for a set of input newswire stories. Since 
			phrasing could not be compared, they compared the generated headlines against 
			the actual headlines, as well as the top ranked summary sentence of the story. Since 
			the system did not have a mechanism to determine the optimal length of a headline, 
			six headlines for each story were generated, ranging in length from 4 to 10 words 
			and they measured the term-overlap between each of the generated headlines and 
			the test. For headline length 4, there was 0.89 overlap in the headline and there was 
			0.91 overlap amongst the top scored sentence, indicating useful results. 
			4.2 Sentence Compression 
			Knight and Marcu (2000) introduced a statistical approach to sentence compression. 
			The authors believe that understanding the simpler task of compressing a sentence 
			may be a fruitful first step to later tackle the problems of single and multi-document 
			summarization. 
			Sentence compression is defined as follows: given a sequence of words W = 
			w1w2 . . . wn that constitute a sentence, find a subsequence wi1 
			wi2 
			. . . wik 
			, with 
			1  i1 < i2 < . . . ik  n, that is a compressed version of W. Note that there 
			are 2n possibilities of output. Knight and Marcu (2000) considered two different 
			approaches: one that is inspired by the noisy-channel model, and another one based 
			on decision trees. Due to its simplicity and elegance, we describe the first approach 
			here. 
			The noisy-channel model considers that one starts with a short summary s, 
			drawn according to the source model P(s), which is then subject to channel noise to 
			become the full sentence t, in a process guided by the channel model P(t|s). When 
			the string t is observed, one wants to recover the original summary according to: 
			 
			s = arg max 
			s 
			P(s|t) = arg max 
			s 
			P(s)P(t|s). (7) 
			This model has the advantage of decoupling the goals of producing a short text that 
			looks grammatical (incorporated in the source model) and of preserving important 
			information (which is done through the channel model). In (Knight and Marcu, 
			2000), the source and channel models are simple models inspired by probabilistic 
			context-free grammars (PCFGs). The following probability mass functions are de- 
			fined over parse trees rather than strings: Ptree(s), the probability of a parse tree 
			that generates s, and Pexpand tree(t|s), the probability that a small parse tree that 
			generates s is expanded to a longer one that generates t. 
			19 
			The sentence t is first parsed by using Collins' parser (Collins, 1999). Then, 
			rather than computing Ptree(s) over all the 2n hypotheses for s, which would be 
			exponential in the sentence length, a shaded-forest structure is used: the parse 
			tree of t is traversed and the grammar (learned from the Penn Treebank22) is used 
			to check recursively which nodes may be removed from each production in order 
			to achieve another valid production. This algorithm allows to compute efficiently 
			Ptree(s) and Pexpand tree(t|s) for all possible grammatical summaries s. Conceptually, 
			the noisy channel model works the other way around: summaries are the original 
			strings that are expanded via expansion templates. Expansion operations have the 
			effect of decreasing the probability Pexpand tree(t|s). The probabilities Ptree(s) and 
			Pexpand tree(t|s) consist in the usual factorized expression for PCFGs times a bigram 
			distribution over the leaves of the tree (i.e. the words). In the end, the log probability 
			is (heuristically) divided by the length of the sentence s in order not to penalize 
			excessively longer sentences (this is done commonly in speech recognition). 
			More recently, Daum 
			e III and Marcu (2002) extended this approach to document 
			compression by using rhetorical structure theory as in Marcu (1998a), where the 
			entire document is represented as a tree, hence allowing not only to compress relevant 
			sentences, but also to drop irrelevant ones. In this framework, Daum 
			e III and Marcu 
			(2004) employed kernel methods to decide for each node in the tree whether or not 
			it should be kept. 
			4.3 Sequential document representation 
			We conclude this section by mentioning some recent work that concerns document 
			representation, with applications in summarization. In the bag-of-words representa- 
			tion (Salton et al., 1975) each document is represented as a sparse vector in a very 
			large Euclidean space, indexed by words in the vocabulary V . A well-known tech- 
			nique in information retrieval to capture word correlation is latent semantic indexing 
			(LSI), that aims to find a linear subspace of dimension k  |V | where documents 
			may be approximately represented by their projections. 
			These classical approaches assume by convenience that Euclidean geometry is 
			a proper model for text documents. As an alternative, Gous (1999) and Hall and 
			Hofmann (2000) used the framework of information geometry (Amari and Nagaoka, 
			2001) to generalize LSI to the multinomial manifold, which can be identified with 
			the probability simplex 
			Pn-1 = x  Rn | 
			n 
			i=1 
			xi = 1, xi  0 for i = 1, . . . , n . (8) 
			Instead of finding a linear subspace, as in the Euclidean case, they learn a subman- 
			ifold of Pn-1. To illustrate this idea, Gous (1999) split a book (Machiavelli's The 
			Prince) into several text blocks (its numbered pages), considered each page as a 
			point in P|V |-1, and projected data into a 2-dimensional submanifold. The result is 
			22See http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~treebank/. 
			20 
			the representation of the book as a sequential path in R2, tracking the evolution of 
			the subject matter of the book over the course of its pages (see Fig. 5). Inspired by 
			Figure 5: The 113 pages of The Prince projected onto a 2-dimensional space (ex- 
			tracted from (Gous, 1999)). The inflection around page 85 reflects a real change in 
			the subject matter, where the book shifts from political theory to a more biograph- 
			ical discourse. 
			this framework, Lebanon et al. (2007) suggested representing a document as a sim- 
			plicial curve (i.e. a curve in the probability simplex), yielding the locally weighted 
			bag-of-words (lowbow) model. According to this representation, a length-normalized 
			document is a function x : [0, 1] x V  R+ such that 
			wjV 
			x(t, wj) = 1, for any t  [0, 1]. (9) 
			We can regard the document as a continuous signal, and x(t, wj) as expressing 
			the relevance of word wj at instant t. This generalizes both the pure sequential 
			representation and the (global) bag-of-words model. Let y = (y1, . . . , yn)  V n be 
			a n-length document. The pure sequential representation of y arises by defining 
			x = xseq with: 
			xseq(t, wj) = 
			1, if wj = y tn 
			0, if wj = y tn 
			, 
			(10) 
			where a denotes the smallest integer greater than a. The global bag-of-words 
			representation of x corresponds to defining x = xbow, where 
			xbow(, wj) = 
			1 
			0 
			xseq(t, wj)dt,   [0, 1], j = 1, . . . , |V |. (11) 
			In this case, the curve degenerates into a single point in the simplex, which is 
			the maximum likelihood estimate of the multinomial parameters. An intermediate 
			21 
			representation arises by smoothing (10) via a function f, : [0, 1]  R++, where 
			  [0, 1] and   R++ are respectively a location and a scale parameter. An 
			example of such a smoothing function is the truncated Gaussian defined in [0, 1] 
			and normalized. This allows defining the lowbow representation at  of the n-lenght 
			document (y1, . . . , yn)  V n as the function x : [0, 1] x V  R+ such that: 
			x(, wj) = 
			1 
			0 
			xseq(t, wj)f,(t)dt. (12) 
			The scale of the smoothing function controls the amount of locality/globality in 
			the document representation (see Fig. 6): when    we recover the global bow 
			representation (11); when   0, we approach the pure sequential representation 
			(10). 
			Figure 6: The lowbow representation of a document with |V | = 3, for several values 
			of the scale parameter  (extracted from (Lebanon, 2006)). 
			Representing a document as a simplicial curve allows us to characterize geomet- 
			rically several properties of the document. For example, the tangent vector field 
			along the curve describes sequential "topic trends" and their change; the curvature 
			measures the amount of wigglyness or deviation from a geodesic path. This prop- 
			erties can be useful for tasks like text segmentation or summarization; for example 
			plotting the velocity of the curve ||  
			x()|| along time offers a visualization of the doc- 
			ument where local maxima tend to correspond to topic boundaries (see (Lebanon 
			et al., 2007) for more information).

			5 Evaluation 
			Evaluating a summary is a difficult task because there does not exist an ideal sum- 
			mary for a given document or set of documents. From papers surveyed in the previ- 
			ous sections and elsewhere in literature, it has been found that agreement between 
			human summarizers is quite low, both for evaluating and generating summaries. 
			More than the form of the summary, it is difficult to evaluate the summary con- 
			tent. Another important problem in summary evaluation is the widespread use of 
			disparate metrics. The absence of a standard human or automatic evaluation met- 
			ric makes it very hard to compare different systems and establish a baseline. This 
			problem is not present in other NLP problems, like parsing. Besides this, manual 
			evaluation is too expensive: as stated by Lin (2004), large scale manual evaluation 
			of summaries as in the DUC conferences would require over 3000 hours of human ef- 
			forts. Hence, an evaluation metric having high correlation with human scores would 
			obviate the process of manual evaluation. In this section, we would look at some im- 
			portant recent papers that have been able to create standards in the summarization 
			community. 
			5.1 Human and Automatic Evaluation 
			Lin and Hovy (2002) describe and compare various human and automatic metrics to 
			evaluate summaries. They focus on the evaluation procedure used in the Document 
			Understanding Conference 2001 (DUC-2001), where the Summary Evaluation En- 
			vironment (SEE) interface was used to support the human evaluation part. NIST 
			assessors in DUC-2001 compared manually written ideal summaries with summaries 
			generated automatically by summarization systems and baseline summaries. Each 
			text was decomposed into a list of units (sentences) and displayed in separate win- 
			dows in SEE. To measure the content of summaries, assessors stepped through each 
			model unit (MU) from the ideal summaries and marked all system units (SU) shar- 
			ing content with the current model unit, rating them with scores in the range 1 - 4 
			to specify that the marked system units express all (4), most (3), some (2) or hardly 
			any (1) of the content of the current model unit. Grammaticality, cohesion, and co- 
			herence were also rated similarly by the assessors. The weighted recall at threshold 
			t (where t range from 1 to 4) is then defined as 
			Recallt = 
			Number of MUs marked at or above t 
			Number of MUs in the model summary 
			. (13) 
			An interesting study is presented that shows how unstable the human markings 
			for overlapping units are. For multiple systems, the coverage scores assigned to the 
			same units were different by human assessors 18% of the time for the single document 
			task and 7.6% of the time for multi-document task. The authors also observe that 
			inter-human agreement is quite low in creating extracts from documents ( 40% for 
			single-documents and  29% for multi-documents). To overcome the instability of 
			human evaluations, they proposed using automatic metrics for summary evaluation. 
			23 
			Inspired by the machine translation evaluation metric BLEU (Papineni et al., 2001), 
			they outline an accumulative n-gram matching score (which they call NAMS), 
			NAMS = a1 * NAM1 + a2 * NAM2 + a3 * NAM3 + a4 * NAM4, (14) 
			where the NAMn n-gram hit ratio is defined as: 
			# of matched n-grams between MU and S 
			total # of n-grams in MU 
			(15) 
			with S denoting here the whole system summary, and where only content words 
			were used in forming the n-grams. Different configurations of ai were tried; the 
			best correlation with human judgement (using Spearman's rank order correlation 
			coefficient) was achieved using a configuration giving 2/3 weight to bigram matches 
			and 1/3 to unigrams matches with stemming done by the Porter stemmer. 
			5.2 ROUGE 
			Lin (2004) introduced a set of metrics called Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gist- 
			ing Evaluation (ROUGE)23 that have become standards of automatic evaluation of 
			summaries. 
			In what follows, let R = {r1, . . . , rm} be a set of reference summaries, and let s be 
			a summary generated automatically by some system. Let n(d) be a binary vector 
			representing the n-grams contained in a document d; the i-th component i 
			n 
			(d) is 1 
			if the i-th n-gram is contained in d and 0 otherwise. The metric ROUGE-N is an 
			n-gram recall based statistic that can be computed as follows: 
			ROUGE-N(s) = rR 
			n(r), n(s) 
			rR 
			n(r), n(r) 
			, (16) 
			where ., . denotes the usual inner product of vectors. This measure is closely related 
			to BLEU which is a precision related measure. Unlike other measures previously 
			considered, ROUGE-N can be used for multiple reference summaries, which is quite 
			useful in practical situations. An alternative is taking the most similar summary in 
			the reference set, 
			ROUGE-Nmulti(s) = max 
			rR 
			n(r), n(s) 
			n(r), n(r) 
			. (17) 
			Another metric in (Lin, 2004) applies the concept of longest common subse- 
			quences24 (LCS). The rationale is: the longer the LCS between two summary sen- 
			tences, the more similar they are. Let r1, . . . , ru be the reference sentences of the 
			documents in R, and s a candidate summary (considered as a concatenation of 
			sentences). The ROUGE-L is defined as an LCS based F-measure: 
			ROUGE-L(s) = 
			(1 + 2)RLCSPLCS 
			RLCS + 2PLCS 
			(18) 
			23See http://openrouge.com/default.aspx. 
			24A subsequence of a string s = s1 
			. . . sn 
			is a string of the form si1 
			. . . sin 
			where 1  i1 
			< . . . in 
			 n. 
			24 
			where RLCS(s) = Pu 
			i=1 
			LCS(ri,s) 
			Pu 
			i=1 
			|ri| 
			, PLCS(s) = Pu 
			i=1 
			LCS(ri,s) 
			|s| 
			, |x| denotes the length of 
			sentence x, LCS(x, y) denotes the length of the LCS between sentences x and y, 
			and  is a (usually large) parameter to balance precision and recall. Notice that 
			the LCS function may be computed by a simple dynamic programming approach. 
			The metric (18) is further refined by including weights that penalize subsequence 
			matches that are not consecutive, yielding a new measure denoted ROUGE-W. 
			Yet another measure introduced by Lin (2004) is ROUGE-S, which can be seen 
			as a gappy version of ROUGE-N for n = 2 and is aptly called skip bigram. Let 2(d) 
			be a binary vector indexed by ordered pairs of words; the i-th component i 
			2 
			(d) is 
			1 if the i-th pair is a subsequence of d and 0 otherwise. The metric ROUGE-S is 
			computed as follows: 
			ROUGE-S(s) = 
			(1 + 2)RSPS 
			RS + 2PS 
			(19) 
			where RS(s) = Pu 
			i=1 
			2(ri),2(s) 
			Pu 
			i=1 
			2(ri),2(ri) 
			and PS(s) = Pu 
			i=1 
			2(ri),2(s) 
			2(s),2(s) 
			. 
			The various versions of ROUGE were evaluated by computing the correlation 
			coefficient between ROUGE scores and human judgement scores. ROUGE-2 per- 
			formed the best among the ROUGE-N variants. ROUGE-L, ROUGE-W, and 
			ROUGE-S all performed very well on the DUC-2001 and DUC-2002 datasets. How- 
			ever, correlation achieved with human judgement for multi-document summarization 
			was not as high as single-document ones; improvement on this side of the paradigm 
			is an open research topic. 
			5.3 Information-theoretic Evaluation of Summaries 
			A very recent approach (Lin et al., 2006) proposes to use an information-theoretic 
			method to automatic evaluation of summaries. The central idea is to use a diver- 
			gence measure between a pair of probability distributions, in this case the Jensen- 
			Shannon divergence, where the first distribution is derived from an automatic sum- 
			mary and the second from a set of reference summaries. This approach has the 
			advantage of suiting both the single-document and the multi-document summariza- 
			tion scenarios. 
			Let D = {d1, . . . , dn} be the set of documents to summarize (which is a singleton 
			set in the case of single-document summarization). Assume that a distribution 
			parameterized by R generates reference summaries of the documents in D. The 
			task of summarization can be seen as that of estimating R. Analogously, assume 
			that every summarization system is governed by some distribution parameterized 
			by A. Then, we may define a good summarizer as one for which A is close to R. 
			One information-theoretic measure between distributions that is adequate for this 
			is the KL divergence (Cover and Thomas, 1991), 
			KL(pA ||pR ) = 
			m 
			i=1 
			pA 
			i 
			log 
			pA 
			i 
			pR 
			i 
			. (20) 
			However, the KL divergence is unbounded and goes to infinity whenever pA 
			i 
			vanishes 
			25 
			and pR 
			i 
			does not, which requires using some kind of smoothing when estimating the 
			distributions. Lin et al. (2006) claims that the measure used here should also be 
			symmetric,25 another thing that the KL divergence is not. Hence, they propose to 
			use the Jensen-Shannon divergence which is bounded and symmetric:26 
			JS(pA ||pR ) = 
			1 
			2 
			KL(pA ||r) + 
			1 
			2 
			KL(pR ||r) = 
			= H(r) - 
			1 
			2 
			H(pA ) - 
			1 
			2 
			H(pA ), (21) 
			where r = 1 
			2 
			pA + 1 
			2 
			pR is the average distribution. 
			To evaluate a summary SA given a reference summary SR, the authors propose 
			to use the negative JS divergence between the estimates of pA and pR given the 
			summaries, 
			score(SA|SR) = -JS(p 
			A ||p 
			R ) (22) 
			The parameters are estimated via a posteriori maximization assuming a multi- 
			nomial generation model for each summary (which means that they are modeled as 
			bags-of-words) and using Dirichlet priors (the conjugate priors of the multinomial 
			family). So: 
			 
			A = arg max 
			A 
			p(SA|A)p(A), (23) 
			where (m being the number of distinct words, a1, . . . , am being the word counts in 
			the summary, a0 = m 
			i=1 
			ai) 
			p(SA|A) = 
			(a0 + 1) 
			m 
			i=1 
			(ai + 1) 
			m 
			i=1 
			A,i 
			ai (24) 
			and 
			p(A) = 
			(0) 
			m 
			i=1 
			(i) 
			m 
			i=1 
			A,i 
			i-1 (25) 
			where i are hyper-parameters and 0 = m 
			i=1 
			i. After some algebra, we get 
			 
			A,i = 
			ai + i - 1 
			a0 + 0 - m 
			(26) 
			which is similar to MLE with smoothing.27  
			R is estimated analogously using the 
			reference summary SR. Not surprisingly, if we have more than one reference sum- 
			mary, the MAP estimation given all summaries equals MAP estimation given their 
			concatenation into a single summary. 
			25However, the authors do not give much support for this claim. In our view, there is no reason 
			to require symmetry. 
			26Although this is not mentioned in (Lin et al., 2006), the Jensen-Shannon divergence also satisfies 
			the axioms to be a squared metric, as shown by Endres and Schindelin (2003). It has also a plethora 
			of properties that are presented elsewhere, but this is out of scope of this survey. 
			27In particular if i 
			= 1 it is just maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). 
			26 
			The authors experimented three automatic evaluation schemes (JS with smooth- 
			ing, JS without smoothing, and KL divergence) against manual evaluation; the best 
			performance was achieved by JS without smoothing. This is not surprising since, as 
			seen above, the JS divergence is bounded, unlike the KL divergence, and so it does 
			not require smoothing. Smoothing has the effect of pulling the two distributions 
			more close to the uniform distribution. 
			2 Single-Document Summarization 
			Usually, the flow of information in a given document is not uniform, which means 
			that some parts are more important than others. The major challenge in summa- 
			rization lies in distinguishing the more informative parts of a document from the 
			less ones. Though there have been instances of research describing the automatic 
			creation of abstracts, most work presented in the literature relies on verbatim ex- 
			traction of sentences to address the problem of single-document summarization. In

			this section, we describe some eminent extractive techniques. First, we look at early 
			work from the 1950s and 60s that kicked off research on summarization. Second, 
			we concentrate on approaches involving machine learning techniques published in 
			the 1990s to today. Finally, we briefly describe some techniques that use a more 
			complex natural language analysis to tackle the problem. 
			2.1 Early Work 
			Most early work on single-document summarization focused on technical documents. 
			Perhaps the most cited paper on summarization is that of (Luhn, 1958), that de- 
			scribes research done at IBM in the 1950s. In his work, Luhn proposed that the 
			frequency of a particular word in an article provides an useful measure of its sig- 
			nificance. There are several key ideas put forward in this paper that have assumed 
			importance in later work on summarization. As a first step, words were stemmed to 
			their root forms, and stop words were deleted. Luhn then compiled a list of content 
			words sorted by decreasing frequency, the index providing a significance measure of 
			the word. On a sentence level, a significance factor was derived that reflects the 
			number of occurrences of significant words within a sentence, and the linear distance 
			between them due to the intervention of non-significant words. All sentences are 
			ranked in order of their significance factor, and the top ranking sentences are finally 
			selected to form the auto-abstract. 
			Related work (Baxendale, 1958), also done at IBM and published in the same 
			journal, provides early insight on a particular feature helpful in finding salient parts 
			of documents: the sentence position. Towards this goal, the author examined 200 
			paragraphs to find that in 85% of the paragraphs the topic sentence came as the first 
			one and in 7% of the time it was the last sentence. Thus, a naive but fairly accurate 
			way to select a topic sentence would be to choose one of these two. This positional 
			feature has since been used in many complex machine learning based systems. 
			Edmundson (1969) describes a system that produces document extracts. His 
			primary contribution was the development of a typical structure for an extractive 
			summarization experiment. At first, the author developed a protocol for creating 
			manual extracts, that was applied in a set of 400 technical documents. The two 
			features of word frequency and positional importance were incorporated from the 
			previous two works. Two other features were used: the presence of cue words 
			(presence of words like significant, or hardly), and the skeleton of the document 
			(whether the sentence is a title or heading). Weights were attached to each of these 
			features manually to score each sentence. During evaluation, it was found that about 
			44% of the auto-extracts matched the manual extracts. 
			2.2 Machine Learning Methods 
			In the 1990s, with the advent of machine learning techniques in NLP, a series of semi- 
			nal publications appeared that employed statistical techniques to produce document 
			extracts. While initially most systems assumed feature independence and relied on 
			naive-Bayes methods, others have focused on the choice of appropriate features and 
			3 
			on learning algorithms that make no independence assumptions. Other significant 
			approaches involved hidden Markov models and log-linear models to improve ex- 
			tractive summarization. A very recent paper, in contrast, used neural networks and 
			third party features (like common words in search engine queries) to improve purely 
			extractive single document summarization. We next describe all these approaches 
			in more detail. 
			2.2.1 Naive-Bayes Methods 
			Kupiec et al. (1995) describe a method derived from Edmundson (1969) that is able 
			to learn from data. The classification function categorizes each sentence as worthy 
			of extraction or not, using a naive-Bayes classifier. Let s be a particular sentence, 
			S the set of sentences that make up the summary, and F1, . . . , Fk the features. 
			Assuming independence of the features: 
			P(s  S | F1, F2, ..Fk) = 
			k 
			i=1 
			P(Fi | s  S) * P(s  S) 
			k 
			i=1 
			P(Fi) 
			(1) 
			The features were compliant to (Edmundson, 1969), but additionally included the 
			sentence length and the presence of uppercase words. Each sentence was given a 
			score according to (1), and only the n top sentences were extracted. To evaluate 
			the system, a corpus of technical documents with manual abstracts was used in 
			the following way: for each sentence in the manual abstract, the authors manually 
			analyzed its match with the actual document sentences and created a mapping 
			(e.g. exact match with a sentence, matching a join of two sentences, not matchable, 
			etc.). The auto-extracts were then evaluated against this mapping. Feature analysis 
			revealed that a system using only the position and the cue features, along with the 
			sentence length sentence feature, performed best. 
			Aone et al. (1999) also incorporated a naive-Bayes classifier, but with richer 
			features. They describe a system called DimSum that made use of features like 
			term frequency (tf ) and inverse document frequency (idf) to derive signature words.4 
			The idf was computed from a large corpus of the same domain as the concerned 
			documents. Statistically derived two-noun word collocations were used as units for 
			counting, along with single words. A named-entity tagger was used and each entity 
			was considered as a single token. They also employed some shallow discourse analysis 
			like reference to same entities in the text, maintaining cohesion. The references 
			were resolved at a very shallow level by linking name aliases within a document 
			like "U.S." to "United States", or "IBM" for "International Business Machines". 
			Synonyms and morphological variants were also merged while considering lexical 
			terms, the former being identified by using Wordnet (Miller, 1995). The corpora 
			used in the experiments were from newswire, some of which belonged to the TREC 
			evaluations.

			2.2.2 Rich Features and Decision Trees 
			Lin and Hovy (1997) studied the importance of a single feature, sentence position. 
			Just weighing a sentence by its position in text, which the authors term as the 
			"position method", arises from the idea that texts generally follow a predictable 
			discourse structure, and that the sentences of greater topic centrality tend to occur in 
			certain specifiable locations (e.g. title, abstracts, etc). However, since the discourse 
			structure significantly varies over domains, the position method cannot be defined 
			as naively as in (Baxendale, 1958). The paper makes an important contribution by 
			investigating techniques of tailoring the position method towards optimality over a 
			genre and how it can be evaluated for effectiveness. A newswire corpus was used, the 
			collection of Ziff-Davis texts produced from the TIPSTER5 program; it consists of 
			text about computer and related hardware, accompanied by a set of key topic words 
			and a small abstract of six sentences. For each document in the corpus, the authors 
			measured the yield of each sentence position against the topic keywords. They then 
			ranked the sentence positions by their average yield to produce the Optimal Position 
			Policy (OPP) for topic positions for the genre. 
			Two kinds of evaluation were performed. Previously unseen text was used for 
			testing whether the same procedure would work in a different domain. The first 
			evaluation showed contours exactly like the training documents. In the second eval- 
			uation, word overlap of manual abstracts with the extracted sentences was measured. 
			Windows in abstracts were compared with windows on the selected sentences and 
			corresponding precision and recall values were measured. A high degree of coverage 
			indicated the effectiveness of the position method. 
			In later work, Lin (1999) broke away from the assumption that features are 
			independent of each other and tried to model the problem of sentence extraction 
			using decision trees, instead of a naive-Bayes classifier. He examined a lot of fea- 
			tures and their effect on sentence extraction. The data used in this work is a 
			publicly available collection of texts, classified into various topics, provided by the 
			TIPSTER-SUMMAC6 evaluations, targeted towards information retrieval systems. 
			The dataset contains essential text fragments (phrases, clauses, and sentences) which 
			must be included in summaries to answer some TREC topics. These fragments were 
			each evaluated by a human judge. The experiments described in the paper are with 
			the SUMMARIST system developed at the University of Southern California. The 
			system extracted sentences from the documents and those were matched against 
			human extracts, like most early work on extractive summarization. 
			Some novel features were the query signature (normalized score given to sen- 
			tences depending on number of query words that they contain), IR signature (the 
			m most salient words in the corpus, similar to the signature words of (Aone et al., 
			1999)), numerical data (boolean value 1 given to sentences that contained a num- 
			ber in them), proper name (boolean value 1 given to sentences that contained a 
			proper name in them), pronoun or adjective (boolean value 1 given to sentences 
			5See http://www.itl.nist.gov/iaui/894.02/related_projects/tipster/.

			5 
			that contained a pronoun or adjective in them), weekday or month (similar as pre- 
			vious feature) and quotation (similar as previous feature). It is worth noting that 
			some features like the query signature are question-oriented because of the setting 
			of the evaluation, unlike a generalized summarization framework. 
			The author experimented with various baselines, like using only the positional 
			feature, or using a simple combination of all features by adding their values. When 
			evaluated by matching machine extracted and human extracted sentences, the deci- 
			sion tree classifier was clearly the winner for the whole dataset, but for three topics, 
			a naive combination of features beat it. Lin conjectured that this happened because 
			some of the features were independent of each other. Feature analysis suggested 
			that the IR signature was a valuable feature, corroborating the early findings of 
			Luhn (1958). 
			2.2.3 Hidden Markov Models 
			In contrast with previous approaches, that were mostly feature-based and non- 
			sequential, Conroy and O'leary (2001) modeled the problem of extracting a sentence 
			from a document using a hidden Markov model (HMM). The basic motivation for 
			using a sequential model is to account for local dependencies between sentences. 
			Only three features were used: position of the sentence in the document (built into 
			the state structure of the HMM), number of terms in the sentence, and likeliness of 
			the sentence terms given the document terms.

			Figure 1: Markov model to extract to three summary sentences from a document 
			(Conroy and O'leary, 2001). 
			The HMM was structured as follows: it contained 2s + 1 states, alternating be- 
			tween s summary states and s+1 nonsummary states. The authors allowed "hesita- 
			tion" only in nonsummary states and "skipping next state" only in summary states. 
			Figure 1 shows an example HMM with 7 nodes, corresponding to s = 3. Using the 
			TREC dataset as training corpus, the authors obtained the maximum-likelihood 
			estimate for each transition probability, forming the transition matrix estimate  
			M, 
			whose element (i, j) is the empirical probability of transitioning from state i to j. 
			Associated with each state i was an output function, bi(O) = Pr(O | state i) where 
			O is an observed vector of features. They made a simplifying assumption that the 
			features are multivariate normal. The output function for each state was thus esti- 
			mated by using the training data to compute the maximum likelihood estimate of 
			its mean and covariance matrix. They estimated 2s+1 means, but assumed that all 
			of the output functions shared a common covariance matrix. Evaluation was done 
			6 
			by comparing with human generated extracts. 
			2.2.4 Log-Linear Models 
			Osborne (2002) claims that existing approaches to summarization have always as- 
			sumed feature independence. The author used log-linear models to obviate this 
			assumption and showed empirically that the system produced better extracts than 
			a naive-Bayes model, with a prior appended to both models. Let c be a label, s 
			the item we are interested in labeling, fi the i-th feature, and i the corresponding 
			feature weight. The conditional log-linear model used by Osborne (2002) can be 
			stated as follows: 
			P(c | s) = 
			1 
			Z(s) 
			exp 
			i 
			ifi(c, s) , (2) 
			where Z(s) = c 
			exp ( i 
			ifi(c, s)). In this domain, there are only two possible 
			labels: either the sentence is to be extracted or it is not. The weights were trained 
			by conjugate gradient descent. The authors added a non-uniform prior to the model, 
			claiming that a log-linear model tends to reject too many sentences for inclusion in 
			a summary. The same prior was also added to a naive-Bayes model for comparison. 
			The classification took place as follows: 
			label(s) = arg max 
			cC 
			P(c) * P(s, c) = arg max 
			cC 
			log P(c) + 
			i 
			ifi(c, s) . (3) 
			The authors optimized the prior using the f2 score of the classifier as an objective 
			function on a part of the dataset (in the technical domain). The summaries were 
			evaluated using the standard f2 score where f2 = 2pr 
			p+r 
			, where the precision and recall 
			measures were measured against human generated extracts. The features included 
			word pairs (pairs of words with all words truncated to ten characters), sentence 
			length, sentence position, and naive discourse features like inside introduction or 
			inside conclusion. With respect to f2 score, the log-linear model outperformed the 
			naive-Bayes classifier with the prior, exhibiting the former's effectiveness. 
			2.2.5 Neural Networks and Third Party Features 
			In 2001-02, DUC issued a task of creating a 100-word summary of a single news 
			article. However, the best performing systems in the evaluations could not outper- 
			form the baseline with statistical significance. This extremely strong baseline has 
			been analyzed by Nenkova (2005) and corresponds to the selection of the first n 
			sentences of a newswire article. This surprising result has been attributed to the 
			journalistic convention of putting the most important part of an article in the initial 
			paragraphs. After 2002, the task of single-document summarization for newswire 
			was dropped from DUC. Svore et al. (2007) propose an algorithm based on neu- 
			ral nets and the use of third party datasets to tackle the problem of extractive 
			summarization, outperforming the baseline with statistical significance. 
			7 
			The authors used a dataset containing 1365 documents gathered from CNN.com, 
			each consisting of the title, timestamp, three or four human generated story high- 
			lights and the article text. They considered the task of creating three machine 
			highlights. The human generated highlights were not verbatim extractions from the 
			article itself. The authors evaluated their system using two metrics: the first one 
			concatenated the three highlights produced by the system, concatenated the three 
			human generated highlights, and compared these two blocks; the second metric con- 
			sidered the ordering and compared the sentences on an individual level. 
			Svore et al. (2007) trained a model from the labels and the features for each 
			sentence of an article, that could infer the proper ranking of sentences in a test 
			document. The ranking was accomplished using RankNet (Burges et al., 2005), a 
			pair-based neural network algorithm designed to rank a set of inputs that uses the 
			gradient descent method for training. For the training set, they used ROUGE-1 
			(Lin, 2004) to score the similarity of a human written highlight and a sentence 
			in the document. These similarity scores were used as soft labels during training, 
			contrasting with other approaches where sentences are "hard-labeled", as selected 
			or not. 
			Some of the used features based on position or n-grams frequencies have been 
			observed in previous work. However, the novelty of the framework lay in the use 
			of features that derived information from query logs from Microsoft's news search 
			engine7 and Wikipedia8 entries. The authors conjecture that if a document sentence 
			contained keywords used in the news search engine, or entities found in Wikipedia 
			articles, then there is a greater chance of having that sentence in the highlight. The 
			extracts were evaluated using ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2, and showed statistically 
			significant improvements over the baseline of selecting the first three sentences in a 
			document. 
			2.3 Deep Natural Language Analysis Methods 
			In this subsection, we describe a set of papers that detail approaches towards single- 
			document summarization involving complex natural language analysis techniques. 
			None of these papers solve the problem using machine learning, but rather use a set 
			of heuristics to create document extracts. Most of these techniques try to model the 
			text's discourse structure. 
			Barzilay and Elhadad (1997) describe a work that used considerable amount of 
			linguistic analysis for performing the task of summarization. For a better under- 
			standing of their method, we need to define a lexical chain: it is a sequence of related 
			words in a text, spanning short (adjacent words or sentences) or long distances (en- 
			tire text). The authors' method progressed with the following steps: segmentation 
			of the text, identification of lexical chains, and using strong lexical chains to identify 
			the sentences worthy of extraction. They tried to reach a middle ground between 
			(McKeown and Radev, 1995) and (Luhn, 1958) where the former relied on deep 
			7See http://search.live.com/news. 
			8See http://en.wikipedia.org. 
			8 
			semantic structure of the text, while the latter relied on word statistics of the doc- 
			uments. The authors describe the notion of cohesion in text as a means of sticking 
			together different parts of the text. Lexical cohesion is a notable example where 
			semantically related words are used. For example, let us take a look at the following 
			sentence.9 
			John bought a Jag. He loves the car. (4) 
			Here, the word car refers to the word Jag in the previous sentence, and exemplifies 
			lexical cohesion. The phenomenon of cohesion occurs not only at the word level, 
			but at word sequences too, resulting in lexical chains, which the authors used as 
			a source representation for summarization. Semantically related words and word 
			sequences were identified in the document, and several chains were extracted, that 
			form a representation of the document. To find out lexical chains, the authors used 
			Wordnet (Miller, 1995), applying three generic steps: 
			1. Selecting a set of candidate words. 
			2. For each candidate word, finding an appropriate chain relying on a relatedness 
			criterion among members of the chains, 
			3. If it is found, inserting the word in the chain and updating it accordingly. 
			The relatedness was measured in terms of Wordnet distance. Simple nouns and 
			noun compounds were used as starting point to find the set of candidates. In the 
			final steps, strong lexical chains were used to create the summaries. The chains were 
			scored by their length and homogeneity. Then the authors used a few heuristics to 
			select the significant sentences. 
			In another paper, Ono et al. (1994) put forward a computational model of dis- 
			course for Japanese expository writings, where they elaborate a practical procedure 
			for extracting the discourse rhetorical structure, a binary tree representing relations 
			between chunks of sentences (rhetorical structure trees are used more intensively in 
			(Marcu, 1998a), as we will see below). This structure was extracted using a series 
			of NLP steps: sentence analysis, rhetorical relation extraction, segmentation, can- 
			didate generation and preference judgement. Evaluation was based on the relative 
			importance of rhetorical relations. In the following step, the nodes of the rhetori- 
			cal structure tree were pruned to reduce the sentence, keeping its important parts. 
			Same was done for paragraphs to finally produce the summary. Evaluation was done 
			with respect to sentence coverage and 30 editorial articles of a Japanese newspaper 
			were used as the dataset. The articles had corresponding sets of key sentences and 
			most important key sentences judged by human subjects. The key sentence coverage 
			was about 51% and the most important key sentence coverage was 74%, indicating 
			encouraging results. 
			Marcu (1998a) describes a unique approach towards summarization that, unlike 
			most other previous work, does not assume that the sentences in a document form 
			a flat sequence. This paper used discourse based heuristics with the traditional 
			9Example from http://www.cs.ucd.ie/staff/jcarthy/home/Lex.html. 
			9 
			features that have been used in the summarization literature. The discourse theory 
			used in this paper is the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) that holds between 
			two non-overlapping pieces of text spans: the nucleus and the satellite. The author 
			mentions that the distinction between nuclei and satellites comes from the empir- 
			ical observation that the nucleus expresses what is more essential to the writer's 
			purpose than the satellite; and that the nucleus of a rhetorical relation is compre- 
			hensible independent of the satellite, but not vice versa. Marcu (1998b) describes 
			the details of a rhetorical parser producing a discourse tree. Figure 2 shows an 
			example discourse tree for a text example detailed in the paper. Once such a dis-

			Figure 2: Example of a discourse tree from Marcu (1998a). The numbers in the 
			nodes denote sentence numbers from the text example. The text below the number 
			in selected nodes are rhetorical relations. The dotted nodes are SATELLITES and 
			the normals ones are the NUCLEI. 
			course structure is created, a partial ordering of important units can be developed 
			from the tree. Each equivalence class in the partial ordering is derived from the 
			new sentences at a particular level of the discourse tree. In Figure 2, we observe 
			that sentence 2 is at the root, followed by sentence 8 in the second level. In the 
			third level, sentence 3 and 10 are observed, and so forth. The equivalence classes 
			are 2 > 8 > 3, 10 > 1, 4, 5, 7, 9 > 6. 
			If it is specified that the summary should contain the top k% of the text, the first 
			k% of the units in the partial ordering can be selected to produce the summary. The 
			author talks about a summarization system based just on this method in (Marcu, 
			1998b) and in one of his earlier papers. In this paper, he merged the discourse 
			based heuristics with traditional heuristics. The metrics used were clustering based 
			10 
			metric (each node in the discourse tree was assigned a cluster score; for leaves the 
			score was 0, for the internal nodes it was given by the similarity of the immediate 
			children; discourse tree A was chosen to be better than B if its clustering score 
			was higher), marker based metric (a discourse structure A was chosen to be better 
			than a discourse structure B if A used more rhetorical relations than B), rhetorical 
			clustering based technique (measured the similarity between salient units of two text 
			spans), shape based metric (preferred a discourse tree A over B if A was more skewed 
			towards the right than B), title based metric, position based metric, connectedness 
			based metric (cosine similarity of an unit to all other text units, a discourse structure 
			A was chosen to be better than B if its connectedness measure was more than B). 
			A weighted linear combination of all these scores gave the score of a discourse 
			structure. To find the best combination of heuristics, the author computed the 
			weights that maximized the F-score on the training dataset, which was constituted 
			by newswire articles. To do this, he used a GSAT-like algorithm (Selman et al., 
			1992) that performed a greedy search in a seven dimensional space of the metrics. 
			For a part of his corpus (the TREC dataset), a best F-score of 75.42% was achieved 
			for the 10% summaries which was 3.5% higher than a baseline lead based algorithm, 
			which was very encouraging. 
			3 Multi-Document Summarization 
			Extraction of a single summary from multiple documents has gained interest since 
			mid 1990s, most applications being in the domain of news articles. Several Web- 
			based news clustering systems were inspired by research on multi-document summa- 
			rization, for example Google News,10 Columbia NewsBlaster,11 or News In Essence.12 
			This departs from single-document summarization since the problem involves mul- 
			tiple sources of information that overlap and supplement each other, being contra- 
			dictory at occasions. So the key tasks are not only identifying and coping with 
			redundancy across documents, but also recognizing novelty and ensuring that the 
			final summary is both coherent and complete. 
			The field seems to have been pioneered by the NLP group at Columbia University 
			(McKeown and Radev, 1995), where a summarization system called SUMMONS13 
			was developed by extending already existing technology for template-driven message 
			understanding systems. Although in that early stage multi-document summariza- 
			tion was mainly seen as a task requiring substantial capabilities of both language 
			interpretation and generation, it later gained autonomy, as people coming from dif- 
			ferent communities added new perspectives to the problem. Extractive techniques 
			have been applied, making use of similarity measures between pairs of sentences. 
			Approaches vary on how these similarities are used: some identify common themes 
			through clustering and then select one sentence to represent each cluster (McKeown 
			10See http://news.google.com.

			12See http://NewsInEssence.com.

			11 
			et al., 1999; Radev et al., 2000), others generate a composite sentence from each 
			cluster (Barzilay et al., 1999), while some approaches work dynamically by includ- 
			ing each candidate passage only if it is considered novel with respect to the previous 
			included passages, via maximal marginal relevance (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998). 
			Some recent work extends multi-document summarization to multilingual environ- 
			ments (Evans, 2005). 
			The way the problem is posed has also varied over time. While in some pub- 
			lications it is claimed that extractive techniques would not be effective for multi- 
			document summarization (McKeown and Radev, 1995; McKeown et al., 1999), some 
			years later that claim was overturned, as extractive systems like MEAD14 (Radev 
			et al., 2000) achieved good performance in large scale summarization of news arti- 
			cles. This can be explained by the fact that summarization systems often distinguish 
			among themselves about what their goal actually is. While some systems, like SUM- 
			MONS, are designed to work in strict domains, aiming to build a sort of briefing 
			that highlights differences and updates accross different news reports, putting much 
			emphasis on how information is presented to the user, others, like MEAD, are large 
			scale systems that intend to work in general domains, being more concerned with 
			information content rather than form. Consequently, systems of the former kind re- 
			quire a strong effort on language generation to produce a grammatical and coherent 
			summary, while latter systems are probably more close to the information retrieval 
			paradigm. Abstractive systems like SUMMONS are difficult to replicate, as they 
			heavily rely on the adaptation of internal tools to perform information extraction 
			and language generation. On the other hand, extractive systems are generally easy 
			to implement from scratch, and this makes them appealing when sophisticated NLP 
			tools are not available. 
			3.1 Abstraction and Information Fusion 
			As far as we know, SUMMONS (McKeown and Radev, 1995; Radev and McKeown, 
			1998) is the first historical example of a multi-document summarization system. It 
			tackles single events about a narrow domain (news articles about terrorism) and 
			produces a briefing merging relevant information about each event and how reports 
			by different news agencies have evolved over time. The whole thread of reports is 
			then presented, as illustrated in the following example of a "good" summary: 
			"In the afternoon of February 26, 1993, Reuters reported that a suspect 
			bomb killed at least five people in the World Trade Center. However, 
			Associated Press announced that exactly five people were killed in the 
			blast. Finally, Associated Press announced that Arab terrorists were 
			possibly responsible for the terrorist act." 
			Rather than working with raw text, SUMMONS reads a database previously 
			built by a template-based message understanding system. A full multi-document

			12 
			summarizer is built by concatenating the two systems, first processing full text as 
			input and filling template slots, and then synthesizing a summary from the extracted 
			information. The architecture of SUMMONS consists of two major components: a 
			content planner that selects the information to include in the summary through 
			combination of the input templates, and a linguistic generator that selects the right 
			words to express the information in grammatical and coherent text. The latter 
			component was devised by adapting existing language generation tools, namely the 
			FUF/SURGE system15. Content planning, on the other hand, is made through 
			summary operators, a set of heuristic rules that perform operations like "change of 
			perspective", "contradiction", "refinement", etc. Some of these operations require 
			resolving conflicts, i.e., contradictory information among different sources or time 
			instants; others complete pieces of information that are included in some articles 
			and not in others, combining them into a single template. At the end, the linguis- 
			tic generator gathers all the combined information and uses connective phrases to 
			synthesize a summary. 
			While this framework seems promising when the domain is narrow enough so that 
			the templates can be designed by hand, a generalization for broader domains would 
			be problematic. This was improved later by McKeown et al. (1999) and Barzilay 
			et al. (1999), where the input is now a set of related documents in raw text, like 
			those retrieved by a standard search engine in response to a query. The system starts 
			by identifying themes, i.e., sets of similar text units (usually paragraphs). This is 
			formulated as a clustering problem. To compute a similarity measure between text 
			units, these are mapped to vectors of features, that include single words weighted 
			by their TF-IDF scores, noun phrases, proper nouns, synsets from the Wordnet 
			database and a database of semantic classes of verbs. For each pair of paragraphs, a 
			vector is computed that represents matches on the different features. Decision rules 
			that were learned from data are then used to classify each pair of text units either 
			as similar or dissimilar; this in turn feeds a subsequent algorithm that places the 
			most related paragraphs in the same theme. 
			Once themes are identified, the system enters its second stage: information fu- 
			sion. The goal is to decide which sentences of a theme should be included in the 
			summary. Rather than just picking a sentence that is a group representative, the 
			authors propose an algorithm which compares and intersects predicate argument 
			structures of the phrases within each theme to determine which are repeated often 
			enough to be included in the summary. This is done as follows: first, sentences are 
			parsed through Collins' statistical parser (Collins, 1999) and converted into depen- 
			dency trees, which allows capturing the predicate-argument structure and identify 
			functional roles. Determiners and auxiliaries are dropped; Fig. 3 shows a sentence 
			representation. 
			The comparison algorithm then traverses these dependency trees recursively, 
			adding identical nodes to the output tree. Once full phrases (a verb with at least 
			two constituents) are found, they are marked to be included in the summary. If two 
			15FUF, SURGE, and other tools developed by the Columbia NLP group are available at

			13 
			and Kan 1998]. We match two verbs that share the same 
			semantic class in this classifi cation. 
			In addition to the above primitive features that all com- 
			pare single items from each text unit, we use composite fea- 
			tures that combine pairs of primitive features. Our compos- 
			ite features impose particular constraints on the order of the 
			two elements in the pair, on the maximum distance between 
			the two elements, and on the syntactic classes that the two 
			elements come from. They can vary from a simple com- 
			bination (e.g., "two text units must share two words to be 
			similar") to complex cases with many conditions (e.g., "two 
			text units must have matching noun phrases that appear in 
			the same order and with relative difference in position no 
			more than fi ve"). In this manner, we capture information 
			on how similarly related elements are spaced out in the two 
			text units, as well as syntactic information on word combi- 
			nations. Matches on composite features indicate combined 
			evidence for the similarity of the two units. 
			To determine whether the units match overall, we employ 
			a machine learning algorithm [Cohen 1996] that induces de- 
			cision rules using the features that really make a difference. 
			A set of pairs of units already marked as similar or not by a 
			human is used for training the classifi er. We have manually 
			marked a set of 8,225 paragraph comparisons from the TDT 
			corpus for training and evaluating our similarity classifi er. 
			For comparison, we also use an implementation of the 
			TF*IDF method which is standard for matching texts in in- 
			formation retrieval. We compute the total frequency (TF) of 
			words in each text unit and the number of units in our train- 
			ing set each word appears in (DF, or document frequency). 
			Then each text unit is represented as a vector of TF*IDF 
			scores, calculated as 
			TF(wordi 
			) * log Total number of units 
			DF(wordi 
			) 
			Similarity between text units is measured by the cosine of 
			the angle between the corresponding two vectors (i.e., the 
			normalized inner product of the two vectors), and the opti- 
			mal value of a threshold for judging two units as similar is 
			computed from the training set. 
			After all pairwise similarities between text units have 
			been calculated, we utilize a clustering algorithm to iden- 
			tify themes. As a paragraph may belong to multiple themes, 
			most standard clustering algorithms, which partition their 
			input set, are not suitable for our task. We use a greedy, 
			one-pass algorithm that fi rst constructs groups from the most 
			similar paragraphs, seeding the groups with the fully con- 
			nected subcomponents of the graph that the similarity rela- 
			tionship induces over the set of paragraphs, and then places 
			additional paragraphs within a group if the fraction of the 
			members of the group they are similar to exceeds a preset 
			threshold. 
			Language Generation 
			Given a group of similar paragraphs--a theme--the prob- 
			lem is to create a concise and fluent fusion of information in 
			this theme, reflecting facts common to all paragraphs. A 
			straightforward method would be to pick a representative 
			subject 
			class: noun 
			27 
			class: cardinal 
			bombing 
			class: noun 
			McVeigh with 
			class: preposition 
			definite: yes 
			charge 
			class: verb voice :passive 
			polarity: + 
			tense: past

			sentence that meets some criteria (e.g., a threshold number 
			of common content words). In practice, however, any repre- 
			sentative sentence will usually include embedded phrase(s) 
			containing information that is not common to all sentences 
			in the theme. Furthermore, other sentences in the theme of- 
			ten contain additional information not presented in the rep- 
			resentative sentence. Our approach, therefore, uses inter- 
			section among theme sentences to identify phrases common 
			to most paragraphs and then generates a new sentence from 
			identifi ed phrases. 
			Intersection among Theme Sentences 
			Intersection is carried out in the content planner, which uses 
			a parser for interpreting the input sentences, with our new 
			work focusing on the comparison of phrases. Theme sen- 
			tences are fi rst run through a statistical parser[Collins 1996] 
			and then, in order to identify functional roles (e.g., subject, 
			object), are converted to a dependency grammar representa- 
			tion [Kittredge and Mel' 
			cuk 1983], which makes predicate- 
			argument structure explicit. 
			We developed a rule-based component to produce func- 
			tional roles, which transforms the phrase-structure output of 
			Collins' parser to dependency grammar; function words (de- 
			terminers and auxiliaries) are eliminated from the tree and 
			corresponding syntactic features are updated. An example 
			of a theme sentence and its dependency grammar represen- 
			tation are shown in Figure 4. Each non-auxiliary word in the 
			sentence has a node in the representation, and this node is 
			connected to its direct dependents. 
			The comparison algorithm starts with all subtrees rooted 
			at verbs from the input dependency structure, and traverses 
			them recursively: if two nodes are identical, they are added 
			to the output tree, and their children are compared. Once 
			a full phrase (verb with at least two constituents) has been 
			found, it is confi rmed for inclusion in the summary. 
			Diffi culties arise when two nodes are not identical, but are 
			similar. Such phrases may be paraphrases of each other and 
			still convey essentially the same information. Since theme 
			sentences are a priori close semantically, this signifi cantly

			with the bombing" (extracted from (McKeown et al., 1999)). 
			phrases, rooted at some node, are not identical but yet similar, the hypothesis that 
			they are paraphrases of each other is considered; to take this into account, corpus- 
			driven paraphrasing rules are written to allow paraphrase intersection.16 Once the 
			summary content (represented as predicate-argument structures) is decided, a gram- 
			matical text is generated by translating those structures into the arguments expected 
			by the FUF/SURGE language generation system. 
			3.2 Topic-driven Summarization and MMR 
			Carbonell and Goldstein (1998) made a major contribution to topic-driven sum- 
			marization by introducing the maximal marginal relevance (MMR) measure. The 
			idea is to combine query relevance with information novelty; it may be applicable 
			in several tasks ranging from text retrieval to topic-driven summarization. MMR 
			simultaneously rewards relevant sentences and penalizes redundant ones by consid- 
			ering a linear combination of two similarity measures. 
			Let Q be a query or user profile and R a ranked list of documents retrieved by 
			a search engine. Consider an incremental procedure that selects documents, one at 
			a time, and adds them to a set S. So let S be the set of already selected documents 
			in a particular step, and R \ S the set of yet unselected documents in R. For each 
			candidate document Di  R \ S, its marginal relevance MR(Di) is computed as: 
			MR(Di) := Sim1(Di, Q) - (1 - ) max 
			DjS 
			Sim2(Di, Dj) (5) 
			where  is a parameter lying in [0, 1] that controls the relative importance given 
			to relevance versus redundancy. Sim1 and Sim2 are two similarity measures; in the 
			16A full description of the kind of paraphrasing rules used can be found in (Barzilay et al., 
			1999). Examples are: ordering of sentence components, main clause vs. relative clause, realization 
			in different syntactic categories (e.g. classifier vs. apposition), change in grammatical features 
			(active/passive, time, number, etc.), head omission, transformation from one POS to another, 
			using semantically related words (e.g. synonyms), etc. 
			14 
			experiments both were set to the standard cosine similarity traditionally used in the 
			vector space model, Sim1(x, y) = Sim2(x, y) = x,y 
			x * y 
			. The document achieving the 
			highest marginal relevance, DMMR = arg maxDiR\S 
			MR(Di), is then selected, i.e., 
			added to S, and the procedure continues until a maximum number of documents 
			are selected or a minimum relevance threshold is attained. Carbonell and Goldstein 
			(1998) found experimentally that choosing dynamically the value of  turns out to be 
			more effective than keeping it fixed, namely starting with small values (  0.3) to 
			give more emphasis to novelty, and then increasing it (  0.7) to focus on the most 
			relevant documents. To perform summarization, documents can be first segmented 
			into sentences or paragraphs, and after a query is submitted, the MMR algorithm 
			can be applied followed by a selection of the top ranking passages, reordering them as 
			they appeared in the original documents, and presenting the result as the summary. 
			One of the attractive points in using MMR for summarization is its topic-oriented 
			feature, through its dependency on the query Q, which makes it particularly ap- 
			pealing to generate summaries according to a user profile: as the authors claim, "a 
			different user with different information needs may require a totally different sum- 
			mary of the same document." This assertion was not being taken into account by 
			previous multi-document summarization systems. 
			3.3 Graph Spreading Activation 
			Mani and Bloedorn (1997) describe an information extraction framework for sum- 
			marization, a graph-based method to find similarities and dissimilarities in pairs 
			of documents. Albeit no textual summary is generated, the summary content is 
			represented via entities (concepts) and relations that are displayed respectively as 
			nodes and edges of a graph. Rather than extracting sentences, they detect salient 
			regions of the graph via a spreading activation technique.17 
			This approach shares with the method described in Section 3.2 the property 
			of being topic-driven; there is an additional input that stands for the topic with 
			respect to which the summary is to be generated. The topic is represented through 
			a set of entry nodes in the graph. A document is represented as a graph as follows: 
			each node represents the occurrence of a single word (i.e., one word together with 
			its position in the text). Each node can have several kinds of links: adjacency 
			links (ADJ) to adjacent words in the text, SAME links to other occurrences of the 
			same word, and ALPHA links encoding semantic relationships captured through 
			Wordnet and NetOwl18. Besides these, PHRASE links tie together sequences of 
			adjacent nodes which belong to the same phrase, and NAME and COREF links 
			stand for co-referential name occurrences; Fig. 4 shows some of these links. 
			Once the graph is built, topic nodes are identified by stem comparison and be- 
			come the entry nodes. A search for semantically related text is then propagated from 
			these to the other nodes of the graph, in a process called spreading activation. Salient 
			17The name "spreading activation" is borrowed from a method used in information retrieval 
			(Salton and Buckley, 1988) to expand the search vocabulary.

			words and phrases are initialized according to their TF-IDF score. The weight of 
			neighboring nodes depends on the node link traveled and is an exponentially decay- 
			ing function of the distance of the traversed path. Traveling within a sentence is 
			made cheaper than across sentence boundaries, which in turn is cheaper than across 
			paragraph boundaries. Given a pair of document graphs, common nodes are identi- 
			fied either by sharing the same stem or by being synonyms. Analogously, difference 
			nodes are those that are not common. For each sentence in both documents, two 
			scores are computed: one score that reflects the presence of common nodes, which 
			is computed as the average weight of these nodes; and another score that computes 
			instead the average weights of difference nodes. Both scores are computed after 
			spreading activation. In the end, the sentences that have higher common and dif- 
			ferent scores are highlighted, the user being able to specify the maximal number of 
			common and different sentences to control the output. In the future, the authors 
			expect to use these structure to actually compose abstractive summaries, rather 
			than just highlighting pieces of text. 
			3.4 Centroid-based Summarization 
			Although clustering techniques were already being employed by McKeown et al. 
			(1999) and Barzilay et al. (1999) for identification of themes, Radev et al. (2000) 
			pioneered the use of cluster centroids to play a central role in summarization. A full 
			description of the centroid-based approach that underlies the MEAD system can 
			be found in (Radev et al., 2004); here we sketch briefly the main points. Perhaps 
			the most appealing feature is the fact that it does not make use of any language 
			generation module, unlike most previous systems. All documents are modeled as 
			bags-of-words. The system is also easily scalable and domain-independent. 
			The first stage consists of topic detection, whose goal is to group together news 
			articles that describe the same event. To accomplish this task, an agglomerative 
			clustering algorithm is used that operates over the TF-IDF vector representations 
			of the documents, successively adding documents to clusters and recomputing the 
			16 
			centroids according to 
			cj = dCj 
			 
			d 
			|Cj| 
			(6) 
			where cj is the centroid of the j-th cluster, Cj is the set of documents that belong 
			to that cluster, its cardinality being |Cj|, and  
			d is a "truncated version" of d that 
			vanishes on those words whose TF-IDF scores are below a threshold. Centroids 
			can thus be regarded as pseudo-documents that include those words whose TF- 
			IDF scores are above a threshold in the documents that constitute the cluster. Each 
			event cluster is a collection of (typically 2 to 10) news articles from multiple sources, 
			chronologically ordered, describing an event as it develops over time. 
			The second stage uses the centroids to identify sentences in each cluster that 
			are central to the topic of the entire cluster. In (Radev et al., 2000), two metrics 
			are defined that resemble the two summands in the MMR (see Section 3.2): cluster- 
			based relative utility (CBRU) and cross-sentence informational subsumption (CSIS). 
			The first accounts for how relevant a particular sentence is to the general topic of 
			the entire cluster; the second is a measure of redundancy among sentences. Unlike 
			MMR, these metrics are not query-dependent. Given one cluster C of documents 
			segmented into n sentences, and a compression rate R, a sequence of nR sentences 
			are extracted in the same order as they appear in the original documents, which in 
			turn are ordered chronologically. The selection of the sentences is made by approx- 
			imating their CBRU and CSIS.19 For each sentence si, three different features are 
			used: 
			* Its centroid value (Ci), defined as the sum of the centroid values of all the 
			words in the sentence, 
			* A positional value (Pi), that is used to make leading sentences more important. 
			Let Cmax be the centroid value of the highest ranked sentence in the document. 
			Then Pi = n-i+1 
			n 
			Cmax. 
			* The first-sentence overlap (Fi), defined as the inner product between the word 
			occurrence vector of sentence i and that of the first sentence of the document. 
			The final score of each sentence is a combination of the three scores above minus a 
			redundancy penalty (Rs) for each sentence that overlaps highly ranked sentences. 
			3.5 Multilingual Multi-document Summarization 
			Evans (2005) addresses the task of summarizing documents written in multiple 
			languages; this had already been sketched by Hovy and Lin (1999). Multilingual 
			summarization is still at an early stage, but this framework looks quite useful for 
			newswire applications that need to combine information from foreign news agen- 
			cies. Evans (2005) considered the scenario where there is a preferred language in 
			which the summary is to be written, and multiple documents in the preferred and 
			19The two metrics are used directly for evaluation (see (Radev et al., 2004) for more details). 
			17 
			in foreign languages are available. In their experiments, the preferred language was 
			English and the documents are news articles in English and Arabic. The rationale is 
			to summarize the English articles without discarding the information contained in 
			the Arabic documents. The IBM's statistical machine translation system is first ap- 
			plied to translate the Arabic documents to English. Then a search is made, for each 
			translated text unit, to see whether there is a similar sentence or not in the English 
			documents. If so, and if the sentence is found relevant enough to be included in the 
			summary, the similar English sentence is included instead of the Arabic-to-English 
			translation. This way, the final summary is more likely to be grammatical, since 
			machine translation is known to be far from perfect. On the other hand, the result 
			is also expected to have higher coverage than using just the English documents, 
			since the information contained in the Arabic documents can help to decide about 
			the relevance of each sentence. In order to measure similarity between sentences, a 
			tool named SimFinder20 was employed: this is a tool for clustering text based on 
			similarity over a variety of lexical and syntactic features using a log-linear regression 
			model. 
			4 Other Approaches to Summarization 
			This section describes briefly some unconventional approaches that, rather than 
			aiming to build full summarization systems, investigate some details that underlie 
			the summarization process, and that we conjecture to have a role to play in future 
			research on this field. 
			4.1 Short Summaries 
			Witbrock and Mittal (1999) claim that extractive summarization is not very pow- 
			erful in that the extracts are not concise enough when very short summaries are 
			required. They present a system that generated headline style summaries. The cor- 
			pus used in this work was newswire articles from Reuters and the Associated Press, 
			publicly available at the LDC21. The system learned statistical models of the rela- 
			tionship between source text units and headline units. It attempted to model both 
			the order and the likelihood of the appearance of tokens in the target documents. 
			Both the models, one for content selection and the other for surface realization were 
			used to co-constrain each other during the search in the summary generation task. 
			For content selection, the model learned a translation model between a docu- 
			ment and its summary (Brown et al., 1993). This model in the simplest case can be 
			thought as a mapping between a word in the document and the likelihood of some 
			word appearing in the summary. To simplify the model, the authors assumed that 
			the probability of a word appearing in a summary is independent of its structure. 
			This mapping boils down to the fact that the probability of a particular summary 
			20See http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/nlp/tools.cgi#SimFinder. 
			21See http://ldc.upenn.edu. 
			18 
			candidate is the product of the probabilities of the summary content and that con- 
			tent being expressed using a particular structure. 
			The surface realization model used was a bigram model. Viterbi beam search 
			was used to efficiently find a near-optimal summary. The Markov assumption was 
			violated by using backtracking at every state to strongly discourage paths that 
			repeated terms, since bigrams that start repeating often seem to pathologically 
			overwhelm the search otherwise. To evaluate the system, the authors compared 
			its output against the actual headlines for a set of input newswire stories. Since 
			phrasing could not be compared, they compared the generated headlines against 
			the actual headlines, as well as the top ranked summary sentence of the story. Since 
			the system did not have a mechanism to determine the optimal length of a headline, 
			six headlines for each story were generated, ranging in length from 4 to 10 words 
			and they measured the term-overlap between each of the generated headlines and 
			the test. For headline length 4, there was 0.89 overlap in the headline and there was 
			0.91 overlap amongst the top scored sentence, indicating useful results. 
			4.2 Sentence Compression 
			Knight and Marcu (2000) introduced a statistical approach to sentence compression. 
			The authors believe that understanding the simpler task of compressing a sentence 
			may be a fruitful first step to later tackle the problems of single and multi-document 
			summarization. 
			Sentence compression is defined as follows: given a sequence of words W = 
			w1w2 . . . wn that constitute a sentence, find a subsequence wi1 
			wi2 
			. . . wik 
			, with 
			1  i1 < i2 < . . . ik  n, that is a compressed version of W. Note that there 
			are 2n possibilities of output. Knight and Marcu (2000) considered two different 
			approaches: one that is inspired by the noisy-channel model, and another one based 
			on decision trees. Due to its simplicity and elegance, we describe the first approach 
			here. 
			The noisy-channel model considers that one starts with a short summary s, 
			drawn according to the source model P(s), which is then subject to channel noise to 
			become the full sentence t, in a process guided by the channel model P(t|s). When 
			the string t is observed, one wants to recover the original summary according to: 
			 
			s = arg max 
			s 
			P(s|t) = arg max 
			s 
			P(s)P(t|s). (7) 
			This model has the advantage of decoupling the goals of producing a short text that 
			looks grammatical (incorporated in the source model) and of preserving important 
			information (which is done through the channel model). In (Knight and Marcu, 
			2000), the source and channel models are simple models inspired by probabilistic 
			context-free grammars (PCFGs). The following probability mass functions are de- 
			fined over parse trees rather than strings: Ptree(s), the probability of a parse tree 
			that generates s, and Pexpand tree(t|s), the probability that a small parse tree that 
			generates s is expanded to a longer one that generates t. 
			19 
			The sentence t is first parsed by using Collins' parser (Collins, 1999). Then, 
			rather than computing Ptree(s) over all the 2n hypotheses for s, which would be 
			exponential in the sentence length, a shaded-forest structure is used: the parse 
			tree of t is traversed and the grammar (learned from the Penn Treebank22) is used 
			to check recursively which nodes may be removed from each production in order 
			to achieve another valid production. This algorithm allows to compute efficiently 
			Ptree(s) and Pexpand tree(t|s) for all possible grammatical summaries s. Conceptually, 
			the noisy channel model works the other way around: summaries are the original 
			strings that are expanded via expansion templates. Expansion operations have the 
			effect of decreasing the probability Pexpand tree(t|s). The probabilities Ptree(s) and 
			Pexpand tree(t|s) consist in the usual factorized expression for PCFGs times a bigram 
			distribution over the leaves of the tree (i.e. the words). In the end, the log probability 
			is (heuristically) divided by the length of the sentence s in order not to penalize 
			excessively longer sentences (this is done commonly in speech recognition). 
			More recently, Daum 
			e III and Marcu (2002) extended this approach to document 
			compression by using rhetorical structure theory as in Marcu (1998a), where the 
			entire document is represented as a tree, hence allowing not only to compress relevant 
			sentences, but also to drop irrelevant ones. In this framework, Daum 
			e III and Marcu 
			(2004) employed kernel methods to decide for each node in the tree whether or not 
			it should be kept. 
			4.3 Sequential document representation 
			We conclude this section by mentioning some recent work that concerns document 
			representation, with applications in summarization. In the bag-of-words representa- 
			tion (Salton et al., 1975) each document is represented as a sparse vector in a very 
			large Euclidean space, indexed by words in the vocabulary V . A well-known tech- 
			nique in information retrieval to capture word correlation is latent semantic indexing 
			(LSI), that aims to find a linear subspace of dimension k  |V | where documents 
			may be approximately represented by their projections. 
			These classical approaches assume by convenience that Euclidean geometry is 
			a proper model for text documents. As an alternative, Gous (1999) and Hall and 
			Hofmann (2000) used the framework of information geometry (Amari and Nagaoka, 
			2001) to generalize LSI to the multinomial manifold, which can be identified with 
			the probability simplex 
			Pn-1 = x  Rn | 
			n 
			i=1 
			xi = 1, xi  0 for i = 1, . . . , n . (8) 
			Instead of finding a linear subspace, as in the Euclidean case, they learn a subman- 
			ifold of Pn-1. To illustrate this idea, Gous (1999) split a book (Machiavelli's The 
			Prince) into several text blocks (its numbered pages), considered each page as a 
			point in P|V |-1, and projected data into a 2-dimensional submanifold. The result is 
			22See http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~treebank/. 
			20 
			the representation of the book as a sequential path in R2, tracking the evolution of 
			the subject matter of the book over the course of its pages (see Fig. 5). Inspired by 
			Figure 5: The 113 pages of The Prince projected onto a 2-dimensional space (ex- 
			tracted from (Gous, 1999)). The inflection around page 85 reflects a real change in 
			the subject matter, where the book shifts from political theory to a more biograph- 
			ical discourse. 
			this framework, Lebanon et al. (2007) suggested representing a document as a sim- 
			plicial curve (i.e. a curve in the probability simplex), yielding the locally weighted 
			bag-of-words (lowbow) model. According to this representation, a length-normalized 
			document is a function x : [0, 1] x V  R+ such that 
			wjV 
			x(t, wj) = 1, for any t  [0, 1]. (9) 
			We can regard the document as a continuous signal, and x(t, wj) as expressing 
			the relevance of word wj at instant t. This generalizes both the pure sequential 
			representation and the (global) bag-of-words model. Let y = (y1, . . . , yn)  V n be 
			a n-length document. The pure sequential representation of y arises by defining 
			x = xseq with: 
			xseq(t, wj) = 
			1, if wj = y tn 
			0, if wj = y tn 
			, 
			(10) 
			where a denotes the smallest integer greater than a. The global bag-of-words 
			representation of x corresponds to defining x = xbow, where 
			xbow(, wj) = 
			1 
			0 
			xseq(t, wj)dt,   [0, 1], j = 1, . . . , |V |. (11) 
			In this case, the curve degenerates into a single point in the simplex, which is 
			the maximum likelihood estimate of the multinomial parameters. An intermediate 
			21 
			representation arises by smoothing (10) via a function f, : [0, 1]  R++, where 
			  [0, 1] and   R++ are respectively a location and a scale parameter. An 
			example of such a smoothing function is the truncated Gaussian defined in [0, 1] 
			and normalized. This allows defining the lowbow representation at  of the n-lenght 
			document (y1, . . . , yn)  V n as the function x : [0, 1] x V  R+ such that: 
			x(, wj) = 
			1 
			0 
			xseq(t, wj)f,(t)dt. (12) 
			The scale of the smoothing function controls the amount of locality/globality in 
			the document representation (see Fig. 6): when    we recover the global bow 
			representation (11); when   0, we approach the pure sequential representation 
			(10). 
			Figure 6: The lowbow representation of a document with |V | = 3, for several values 
			of the scale parameter  (extracted from (Lebanon, 2006)). 
			Representing a document as a simplicial curve allows us to characterize geomet- 
			rically several properties of the document. For example, the tangent vector field 
			along the curve describes sequential "topic trends" and their change; the curvature 
			measures the amount of wigglyness or deviation from a geodesic path. This prop- 
			erties can be useful for tasks like text segmentation or summarization; for example 
			plotting the velocity of the curve ||  
			x()|| along time offers a visualization of the doc- 
			ument where local maxima tend to correspond to topic boundaries (see (Lebanon 
			et al., 2007) for more information).

			5 Evaluation 
			Evaluating a summary is a difficult task because there does not exist an ideal sum- 
			mary for a given document or set of documents. From papers surveyed in the previ- 
			ous sections and elsewhere in literature, it has been found that agreement between 
			human summarizers is quite low, both for evaluating and generating summaries. 
			More than the form of the summary, it is difficult to evaluate the summary con- 
			tent. Another important problem in summary evaluation is the widespread use of 
			disparate metrics. The absence of a standard human or automatic evaluation met- 
			ric makes it very hard to compare different systems and establish a baseline. This 
			problem is not present in other NLP problems, like parsing. Besides this, manual 
			evaluation is too expensive: as stated by Lin (2004), large scale manual evaluation 
			of summaries as in the DUC conferences would require over 3000 hours of human ef- 
			forts. Hence, an evaluation metric having high correlation with human scores would 
			obviate the process of manual evaluation. In this section, we would look at some im- 
			portant recent papers that have been able to create standards in the summarization 
			community. 
			5.1 Human and Automatic Evaluation 
			Lin and Hovy (2002) describe and compare various human and automatic metrics to 
			evaluate summaries. They focus on the evaluation procedure used in the Document 
			Understanding Conference 2001 (DUC-2001), where the Summary Evaluation En- 
			vironment (SEE) interface was used to support the human evaluation part. NIST 
			assessors in DUC-2001 compared manually written ideal summaries with summaries 
			generated automatically by summarization systems and baseline summaries. Each 
			text was decomposed into a list of units (sentences) and displayed in separate win- 
			dows in SEE. To measure the content of summaries, assessors stepped through each 
			model unit (MU) from the ideal summaries and marked all system units (SU) shar- 
			ing content with the current model unit, rating them with scores in the range 1 - 4 
			to specify that the marked system units express all (4), most (3), some (2) or hardly 
			any (1) of the content of the current model unit. Grammaticality, cohesion, and co- 
			herence were also rated similarly by the assessors. The weighted recall at threshold 
			t (where t range from 1 to 4) is then defined as 
			Recallt = 
			Number of MUs marked at or above t 
			Number of MUs in the model summary 
			. (13) 
			An interesting study is presented that shows how unstable the human markings 
			for overlapping units are. For multiple systems, the coverage scores assigned to the 
			same units were different by human assessors 18% of the time for the single document 
			task and 7.6% of the time for multi-document task. The authors also observe that 
			inter-human agreement is quite low in creating extracts from documents ( 40% for 
			single-documents and  29% for multi-documents). To overcome the instability of 
			human evaluations, they proposed using automatic metrics for summary evaluation. 
			23 
			Inspired by the machine translation evaluation metric BLEU (Papineni et al., 2001), 
			they outline an accumulative n-gram matching score (which they call NAMS), 
			NAMS = a1 * NAM1 + a2 * NAM2 + a3 * NAM3 + a4 * NAM4, (14) 
			where the NAMn n-gram hit ratio is defined as: 
			# of matched n-grams between MU and S 
			total # of n-grams in MU 
			(15) 
			with S denoting here the whole system summary, and where only content words 
			were used in forming the n-grams. Different configurations of ai were tried; the 
			best correlation with human judgement (using Spearman's rank order correlation 
			coefficient) was achieved using a configuration giving 2/3 weight to bigram matches 
			and 1/3 to unigrams matches with stemming done by the Porter stemmer. 
			5.2 ROUGE 
			Lin (2004) introduced a set of metrics called Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gist- 
			ing Evaluation (ROUGE)23 that have become standards of automatic evaluation of 
			summaries. 
			In what follows, let R = {r1, . . . , rm} be a set of reference summaries, and let s be 
			a summary generated automatically by some system. Let n(d) be a binary vector 
			representing the n-grams contained in a document d; the i-th component i 
			n 
			(d) is 1 
			if the i-th n-gram is contained in d and 0 otherwise. The metric ROUGE-N is an 
			n-gram recall based statistic that can be computed as follows: 
			ROUGE-N(s) = rR 
			n(r), n(s) 
			rR 
			n(r), n(r) 
			, (16) 
			where ., . denotes the usual inner product of vectors. This measure is closely related 
			to BLEU which is a precision related measure. Unlike other measures previously 
			considered, ROUGE-N can be used for multiple reference summaries, which is quite 
			useful in practical situations. An alternative is taking the most similar summary in 
			the reference set, 
			ROUGE-Nmulti(s) = max 
			rR 
			n(r), n(s) 
			n(r), n(r) 
			. (17) 
			Another metric in (Lin, 2004) applies the concept of longest common subse- 
			quences24 (LCS). The rationale is: the longer the LCS between two summary sen- 
			tences, the more similar they are. Let r1, . . . , ru be the reference sentences of the 
			documents in R, and s a candidate summary (considered as a concatenation of 
			sentences). The ROUGE-L is defined as an LCS based F-measure: 
			ROUGE-L(s) = 
			(1 + 2)RLCSPLCS 
			RLCS + 2PLCS 
			(18) 
			23See http://openrouge.com/default.aspx. 
			24A subsequence of a string s = s1 
			. . . sn 
			is a string of the form si1 
			. . . sin 
			where 1  i1 
			< . . . in 
			 n. 
			24 
			where RLCS(s) = Pu 
			i=1 
			LCS(ri,s) 
			Pu 
			i=1 
			|ri| 
			, PLCS(s) = Pu 
			i=1 
			LCS(ri,s) 
			|s| 
			, |x| denotes the length of 
			sentence x, LCS(x, y) denotes the length of the LCS between sentences x and y, 
			and  is a (usually large) parameter to balance precision and recall. Notice that 
			the LCS function may be computed by a simple dynamic programming approach. 
			The metric (18) is further refined by including weights that penalize subsequence 
			matches that are not consecutive, yielding a new measure denoted ROUGE-W. 
			Yet another measure introduced by Lin (2004) is ROUGE-S, which can be seen 
			as a gappy version of ROUGE-N for n = 2 and is aptly called skip bigram. Let 2(d) 
			be a binary vector indexed by ordered pairs of words; the i-th component i 
			2 
			(d) is 
			1 if the i-th pair is a subsequence of d and 0 otherwise. The metric ROUGE-S is 
			computed as follows: 
			ROUGE-S(s) = 
			(1 + 2)RSPS 
			RS + 2PS 
			(19) 
			where RS(s) = Pu 
			i=1 
			2(ri),2(s) 
			Pu 
			i=1 
			2(ri),2(ri) 
			and PS(s) = Pu 
			i=1 
			2(ri),2(s) 
			2(s),2(s) 
			. 
			The various versions of ROUGE were evaluated by computing the correlation 
			coefficient between ROUGE scores and human judgement scores. ROUGE-2 per- 
			formed the best among the ROUGE-N variants. ROUGE-L, ROUGE-W, and 
			ROUGE-S all performed very well on the DUC-2001 and DUC-2002 datasets. How- 
			ever, correlation achieved with human judgement for multi-document summarization 
			was not as high as single-document ones; improvement on this side of the paradigm 
			is an open research topic. 
			5.3 Information-theoretic Evaluation of Summaries 
			A very recent approach (Lin et al., 2006) proposes to use an information-theoretic 
			method to automatic evaluation of summaries. The central idea is to use a diver- 
			gence measure between a pair of probability distributions, in this case the Jensen- 
			Shannon divergence, where the first distribution is derived from an automatic sum- 
			mary and the second from a set of reference summaries. This approach has the 
			advantage of suiting both the single-document and the multi-document summariza- 
			tion scenarios. 
			Let D = {d1, . . . , dn} be the set of documents to summarize (which is a singleton 
			set in the case of single-document summarization). Assume that a distribution 
			parameterized by R generates reference summaries of the documents in D. The 
			task of summarization can be seen as that of estimating R. Analogously, assume 
			that every summarization system is governed by some distribution parameterized 
			by A. Then, we may define a good summarizer as one for which A is close to R. 
			One information-theoretic measure between distributions that is adequate for this 
			is the KL divergence (Cover and Thomas, 1991), 
			KL(pA ||pR ) = 
			m 
			i=1 
			pA 
			i 
			log 
			pA 
			i 
			pR 
			i 
			. (20) 
			However, the KL divergence is unbounded and goes to infinity whenever pA 
			i 
			vanishes 
			25 
			and pR 
			i 
			does not, which requires using some kind of smoothing when estimating the 
			distributions. Lin et al. (2006) claims that the measure used here should also be 
			symmetric,25 another thing that the KL divergence is not. Hence, they propose to 
			use the Jensen-Shannon divergence which is bounded and symmetric:26 
			JS(pA ||pR ) = 
			1 
			2 
			KL(pA ||r) + 
			1 
			2 
			KL(pR ||r) = 
			= H(r) - 
			1 
			2 
			H(pA ) - 
			1 
			2 
			H(pA ), (21) 
			where r = 1 
			2 
			pA + 1 
			2 
			pR is the average distribution. 
			To evaluate a summary SA given a reference summary SR, the authors propose 
			to use the negative JS divergence between the estimates of pA and pR given the 
			summaries, 
			score(SA|SR) = -JS(p 
			A ||p 
			R ) (22) 
			The parameters are estimated via a posteriori maximization assuming a multi- 
			nomial generation model for each summary (which means that they are modeled as 
			bags-of-words) and using Dirichlet priors (the conjugate priors of the multinomial 
			family). So: 
			 
			A = arg max 
			A 
			p(SA|A)p(A), (23) 
			where (m being the number of distinct words, a1, . . . , am being the word counts in 
			the summary, a0 = m 
			i=1 
			ai) 
			p(SA|A) = 
			(a0 + 1) 
			m 
			i=1 
			(ai + 1) 
			m 
			i=1 
			A,i 
			ai (24) 
			and 
			p(A) = 
			(0) 
			m 
			i=1 
			(i) 
			m 
			i=1 
			A,i 
			i-1 (25) 
			where i are hyper-parameters and 0 = m 
			i=1 
			i. After some algebra, we get 
			 
			A,i = 
			ai + i - 1 
			a0 + 0 - m 
			(26) 
			which is similar to MLE with smoothing.27  
			R is estimated analogously using the 
			reference summary SR. Not surprisingly, if we have more than one reference sum- 
			mary, the MAP estimation given all summaries equals MAP estimation given their 
			concatenation into a single summary. 
			25However, the authors do not give much support for this claim. In our view, there is no reason 
			to require symmetry. 
			26Although this is not mentioned in (Lin et al., 2006), the Jensen-Shannon divergence also satisfies 
			the axioms to be a squared metric, as shown by Endres and Schindelin (2003). It has also a plethora 
			of properties that are presented elsewhere, but this is out of scope of this survey. 
			27In particular if i 
			= 1 it is just maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). 
			26 
			The authors experimented three automatic evaluation schemes (JS with smooth- 
			ing, JS without smoothing, and KL divergence) against manual evaluation; the best 
			performance was achieved by JS without smoothing. This is not surprising since, as 
			seen above, the JS divergence is bounded, unlike the KL divergence, and so it does 
			not require smoothing. Smoothing has the effect of pulling the two distributions 
			more close to the uniform distribution. 
			2 Sentence Boundary Detection 
			Sentence Boundary Detection (SBD) has been a major research topic science 
			ASR moved to more general domains as conversational speech [17,24,26]. Per- 
			formance of ASR systems has improved over the years with the inclusion and 
			combination of new Deep Neural Networks methods [5,9,33]. As a general rule, 
			the output of ASR systems lacks of any syntactic information such as capital- 
			ization and sentence boundaries, showing the interest of ASR systems to obtain 
			the correct sequence of words with almost no concern of the overall structure of 
			the document [8]. 
			Similar to SBD is the Punctuation Marks Disambiguation (PMD) or Sentence 
			Boundary Disambiguation. This task aims to segment a formal written text into 
			well formed sentences based on the existent punctuation marks [11,19,20,29]. In 
			this context a sentence is defined (for English) by the Cambridge Dictionary1 
			as: 
			"a group of words, usually containing a verb, that expresses a thought in 
			the form of a statement, question, instruction, or exclamation and starts 
			with a capital letter when written". 
			PMD carries certain complications, some given the ambiguity of punctuation 
			marks within a sentence. A period can denote an acronym, an abbreviation, the 
			end of the sentence or a combination of them as in the following example: 
			The U.S. president, Mr. Donald Trump, is meeting with the F.B.I. 
			director Christopher A. Wray next Thursday at 8 p.m. 
			However its difficulties, DPM profits of morphological and lexical information 
			to achieve a correct sentence segmentation. By contrast, segmenting an ASR 
			transcript should be done without any (or almost any) lexical information and 
			a flurry definition of sentence.

			WiSeBE: Window-Based Sentence Boundary Evaluation 121 
			The obvious division in spoken language may be considered speaker utter- 
			ances. However, in a normal conversation or even in a monologue, the way ideas 
			are organized differs largely from written text. This differences, added to disflu- 
			encies like revisions, repetitions, restarts, interruptions and hesitations make the 
			definition of a sentence unclear thus complicating the segmentation task [27]. 
			Table 1 exemplifies some of the difficulties that are present when working with 
			spoken language. 
			Table 1. Sentence Boundary Detection example

			Stolcke and Shriberg [26] considered a set of linguistic structures as segments 
			including the following list: 
			- Complete sentences 
			- Stand-alone sentences 
			- Disfluent sentences aborted in mid-utterance 
			- Interjections 
			- Back-channel responses. 
			In [17], Meteer and Iyer divided speaker utterances into segments, consisting 
			each of a single independent clause. A segment was considered to begin either 
			at the beginning of an utterance, or after the end of the preceding segment. Any 
			dysfluency between the end of the previous segments and the begging of current 
			one was considered part of the current segments. 
			Rott and  
			Cerva [23] aimed to summarize news delivered orally segmenting the 
			transcripts into "something that is similar to sentences". They used a syntactic 
			analyzer to identify the phrases within the text. 
			A wide study focused in unbalanced data for the SBD task was performed 
			by Liu et al. [15]. During this study they followed the segmentation scheme pro- 
			posed by the Linguistic Data Consortium2 on the Simple Metadata Annotation 
			Specification V5.0 guideline (SimpleMDE V5.0) [27], dividing the transcripts in 
			Semantic Units. 
			2 https://www.ldc.upenn.edu/. 
			122 C.-E. Gonz 
			alez-Gallardo and J.-M. Torres-Moreno 
			A Semantic Unit (SU) is considered to be an atomic element of the transcript 
			that manages to express a complete thought or idea on the part of the speaker 
			[27]. Sometimes a SU corresponds to the equivalent of a sentence in written text, 
			but other times (the most part of them) a SU corresponds to a phrase or a single 
			word. 
			SUs seem to be an inclusive conception of a segment, they embrace different 
			previous segment definitions and are flexible enough to deal with the majority 
			of spoken language troubles. For these reasons we will adopt SUs as our segment 
			definition. 
			2.1 Sentence Boundary Evaluation 
			SBD research has been focused on two different aspects; features and methods. 
			Regarding the features, some work focused on acoustic elements like pauses 
			duration, fundamental frequencies, energy, rate of speech, volume change and 
			speaker turn [10,12,14]. 
			The other kind of features used in SBD are textual or lexical features. They 
			rely on the transcript content to extract features like bag-of-word, POS tags or 
			word embeddings [7,12,16,18,23,26,30]. Mixture of acoustic and lexical features 
			have also been explored [1,13,14,32], which is advantageous when both audio 
			signal and transcript are available. 
			With respect to the methods used for SBD, they mostly rely on statisti- 
			cal/neural machine translation [12,22], language models [8,15,18,26], conditional 
			random fields [16,30] and deep neural networks [3,7,29]. 
			Despite their differences in features and/or methodology, almost all previous 
			cited research share a common element; the evaluation methodology. Metrics as 
			Precision, Recall, F1-score, Classification Error Rate and Slot Error Rate (SER) 
			are used to evaluate the proposed system against one reference. As discussed 
			in Sect. 1, further NLP tasks rely on the result of SBD, meaning that is crucial 
			to have a good segmentation. But comparing the output of a system against a 
			unique reference will provide a reliable score to decide if the system is good or 
			bad? 
			Bohac et al. [1] compared the human ability to punctuate recognized spon- 
			taneous speech. They asked 10 people (correctors) to punctuate about 30 min of 
			ASR transcripts in Czech. For an average of 3,962 words, the punctuation marks 
			placed by correctors varied between 557 and 801; this means a difference of 244 
			segments for the same transcript. Over all correctors, the absolute consensus for 
			period (.) was only 4.6% caused by the replacement of other punctuation marks 
			as semicolons (;) and exclamation marks (!). These results are understandable if 
			we consider the difficulties presented previously in this section. 
			To our knowledge, the amount of studies that have tried to target the sentence 
			boundary evaluation with a multi-reference approach is very small. In [1], Bohac 
			et al. evaluated the overall punctuation accuracy for Czech in a straightforward 
			multi-reference framework. They considered a period (.) valid if at least five of 
			their 10 correctors agreed on its position. 
			WiSeBE: Window-Based Sentence Boundary Evaluation 123 
			Kol 
			a 
			r and Lamel [13] considered two independent references to evaluate their 
			system and proposed two approaches. The fist one was to calculate the SER for 
			each of one the two available references and then compute their mean. They 
			found this approach to be very strict because for those boundaries where no 
			agreement between references existed, the system was going to be partially wrong 
			even the fact that it has correctly predicted the boundary. Their second app- 
			roach tried to moderate the number of unjust penalizations. For this case, a 
			classification was considered incorrect only if it didn't match either of the two 
			references. 
			These two examples exemplify the real need and some straightforward solu- 
			tions for multi-reference evaluation metrics. However, we think that it is possible 
			to consider in a more inclusive approach the similarities and differences that mul- 
			tiple references could provide into a sentence boundary evaluation protocol. 
			3 Window-Based Sentence Boundary Evaluation 
			Window-Based Sentence Boundary Evaluation (WiSeBE) is a semi-automatic 
			multi-reference sentence boundary evaluation protocol which considers the per- 
			formance of a candidate segmentation over a set of segmentation references and 
			the agreement between those references. 
			Let R = {R1 
			, R2 
			, ..., Rm 
			} be the set of all available references given a tran- 
			script T = {t1 
			, t2 
			, ..., tn 
			}, where tj 
			is the jth word in the transcript; a reference 
			Ri 
			is defined as a binary vector in terms of the existent SU boundaries in T. 
			Ri 
			= {b1 
			, b2 
			, ..., bn 
			} (1) 
			where 
			bj 
			= 
			1 if tj 
			is a boundary 
			0 otherwise 
			Given a transcript T, the candidate segmentation CT 
			is defined similar to Ri 
			. 
			CT 
			= {b1 
			, b2 
			, ..., bn 
			} (2) 
			where 
			bj 
			= 
			1 if tj 
			is a boundary 
			0 otherwise 
			3.1 General Reference and Agreement Ratio 
			A General Reference (RG 
			) is then constructed to calculate the agreement ratio 
			between all references in. It is defined by the boundary frequencies of each ref- 
			erence Ri 
			 R. 
			RG 
			= {d1 
			, d2 
			, ..., dn 
			} (3) 
			where 
			124 C.-E. Gonz 
			alez-Gallardo and J.-M. Torres-Moreno 
			dj 
			= 
			m 
			i=1 
			tij 
			tj 
			 T, dj 
			= [0, m] (4) 
			The Agreement Ratio (RGAR 
			) is needed to get a numerical value of the dis- 
			tribution of SU boundaries over R. A value of RGAR 
			close to 0 means a low 
			agreement between references in R, while RGAR 
			= 1 means a perfect agreement 
			(Ri 
			 R, Ri 
			= Ri+1 
			|i = 1, ..., m - 1) in R. 
			RGAR 
			= 
			RGP B 
			RGHA 
			(5) 
			In the equation above, RGP B 
			corresponds to the ponderated common boundaries 
			of RG 
			and RGHA 
			to its hypothetical maximum agreement. 
			RGP B 
			= 
			n 
			j=1 
			dj 
			[dj 
			 2] (6) 
			RGHA 
			= m x 
			dj 
			RG 
			1 [dj 
			= 0] (7) 
			3.2 Window-Boundaries Reference 
			In Sect. 2 we discussed about how disfluencies complicate SU segmentation. In a 
			multi-reference environment this causes disagreement between references around 
			a same SU boundary. The way WiSeBE handle disagreements produced by dis- 
			fluencies is with a Window-boundaries Reference (RW 
			) defined as: 
			RW 
			= {w1 
			, w2 
			, ..., wp 
			} (8) 
			where each window wk 
			considers one or more boundaries dj 
			from RG 
			with a 
			window separation limit equal to RWl 
			. 
			wk 
			= {dj 
			, dj+1 
			, dj+2 
			, ...} (9) 
			3.3 W iSeBE 
			WiSeBE is a normalized score dependent of (1) the performance of CT 
			over RW 
			and (2) the agreement between all references in R. It is defined as: 
			WiSeBE = F1RW 
			x RGAR 
			WiSeBE = [0, 1] (10) 
			where F1RW 
			corresponds to the harmonic mean of precision and recall of CT 
			with respect to RW 
			(Eq. 11), while RGAR 
			is the agreement ratio defined in (5). 
			RGAR 
			can be interpreted as a scaling factor; a low value will penalize the overall 
			WiSeBE score given the low agreement between references. By contrast, for a 
			high agreement in R (RGAR 
			 1), WiSeBE  F1RW 
			. 
			WiSeBE: Window-Based Sentence Boundary Evaluation 125 
			F1RW 
			= 2 x 
			precisionRW 
			x recallRW 
			precisionRW 
			+ recallRW 
			(11) 
			precisionRW 
			= bj

			(12) 
			recallRW 
			= wk 
			RW 
			1 [wk 
			b b  CT 
			] 
			p 
			(13) 
			Equations 12 and 13 describe precision and recall of CT 
			with respect to RW 
			. 
			Precision is the number of boundaries bj 
			inside any window wk 
			from RW 
			divided 
			by the total number of boundaries bj 
			in CT 
			. Recall corresponds to the number 
			of windows w with at least one boundary b divided by the number of windows 
			w in RW 
			. 
			4 Evaluating with W iSeBE 
			To exemplify the WiSeBE score we evaluated and compared the performance 
			of two different SBD systems over a set of YouTube videos in a multi-reference 
			environment. The first system (S1) employs a Convolutional Neural Network to 
			determine if the middle word of a sliding window corresponds to a SU bound- 
			ary or not [6]. The second approach (S2) by contrast, introduces a bidirectional 
			Recurrent Neural Network model with attention mechanism for boundary detec- 
			tion [28]. 
			In a first glance we performed the evaluation of the systems against each 
			one of the references independently. Then, we implemented a multi-reference 
			evaluation with WiSeBE. 
			4.1 Dataset 
			We focused evaluation over a small but diversified dataset composed by 10 
			YouTube videos in the English language in the news context. The selected videos 
			cover different topics like technology, human rights, terrorism and politics with 
			a length variation between 2 and 10 min. To encourage the diversity of content 
			format we included newscasts, interviews, reports and round tables. 
			During the transcription phase we opted for a manual transcription process 
			because we observed that using transcripts from an ASR system will difficult 
			in a large degree the manual segmentation process. The number of words per 
			transcript oscilate between 271 and 1,602 with a total number of 8,080. 
			We gave clear instructions to three evaluators (ref1 
			, ref2 
			, ref3 
			) of how seg- 
			mentation was needed to be perform, including the SU concept and how punctu- 
			ation marks were going to be taken into account. Periods (.), question marks (?), 
			exclamation marks (!) and semicolons (;) were considered SU delimiters (bound- 
			aries) while colons (:) and commas (,) were considered as internal SU marks. 
			The number of segments per transcript and reference can be seen in Table 2. An 
			interesting remark is that ref3 
			assigns about 43% less boundaries than the mean 
			of the other two references.

			4.2 Evaluation 
			We ran both systems (S1 & S2) over the manually transcribed videos obtaining 
			the number of boundaries shown in Table 3. In general, it can be seen that S1 
			predicts 27% more segments than S2. This difference can affect the performance 
			of S1, increasing its probabilities of false positives.

			Table 4 condenses the performance of both systems evaluated against each 
			one of the references independently. If we focus on F1 scores, performance of both 
			systems varies depending of the reference. For ref1 
			, S1 was better in 5 occasions 
			with respect of S2; S1 was better in 2 occasions only for ref2 
			; S1 overperformed 
			S2 in 3 occasions concerning ref3 
			and in 4 occasions for mean (bold). 
			Also from Table 4 we can observe that ref1 
			has a bigger similarity to S1 in 
			5 occasions compared to other two references, while ref2 
			is more similar to S2 
			in 7 transcripts (underline). 
			After computing the mean F1 scores over the transcripts, it can be concluded 
			that in average S2 had a better performance segmenting the dataset compared 
			to S1, obtaining a F1 score equal to 0.510. But... What about the complexity of 
			the dataset? Regardless all references have been considered, nor agreement or 
			disagreement between them has been taken into account. 
			All values related to the WiSeBE score are displayed in Table 5. The Agree- 
			ment Ratio (RGAR 
			) between references oscillates between 0.525 for v8 
			and 0.767 
			for v5 
			. The lower the RGAR 
			, the bigger the penalization WiSeBE will give to 
			the final score. A good example is S2 for transcript v4 
			where F1RW 
			reaches a 
			value of 0.800, but after considering RGAR 
			the WiSeBE score falls to 0.462. 
			It is feasible to think that if all references are taken into account at the same 
			time during evaluation (F1RW 
			), the score will be bigger compared to an average 
			of independent evaluations (F1mean 
			); however this is not always true. That is 
			the case of S1 in v10, which present a slight decrease for F1RW 
			compared to 
			F1mean 
			.

			2 Sentence Boundary Detection 
			Sentence Boundary Detection (SBD) has been a major research topic science 
			ASR moved to more general domains as conversational speech [17,24,26]. Per- 
			formance of ASR systems has improved over the years with the inclusion and 
			combination of new Deep Neural Networks methods [5,9,33]. As a general rule, 
			the output of ASR systems lacks of any syntactic information such as capital- 
			ization and sentence boundaries, showing the interest of ASR systems to obtain 
			the correct sequence of words with almost no concern of the overall structure of 
			the document [8]. 
			Similar to SBD is the Punctuation Marks Disambiguation (PMD) or Sentence 
			Boundary Disambiguation. This task aims to segment a formal written text into 
			well formed sentences based on the existent punctuation marks [11,19,20,29]. In 
			this context a sentence is defined (for English) by the Cambridge Dictionary1 
			as: 
			"a group of words, usually containing a verb, that expresses a thought in 
			the form of a statement, question, instruction, or exclamation and starts 
			with a capital letter when written". 
			PMD carries certain complications, some given the ambiguity of punctuation 
			marks within a sentence. A period can denote an acronym, an abbreviation, the 
			end of the sentence or a combination of them as in the following example: 
			The U.S. president, Mr. Donald Trump, is meeting with the F.B.I. 
			director Christopher A. Wray next Thursday at 8 p.m. 
			However its difficulties, DPM profits of morphological and lexical information 
			to achieve a correct sentence segmentation. By contrast, segmenting an ASR 
			transcript should be done without any (or almost any) lexical information and 
			a flurry definition of sentence.

			WiSeBE: Window-Based Sentence Boundary Evaluation 121 
			The obvious division in spoken language may be considered speaker utter- 
			ances. However, in a normal conversation or even in a monologue, the way ideas 
			are organized differs largely from written text. This differences, added to disflu- 
			encies like revisions, repetitions, restarts, interruptions and hesitations make the 
			definition of a sentence unclear thus complicating the segmentation task [27]. 
			Table 1 exemplifies some of the difficulties that are present when working with 
			spoken language.

			Stolcke and Shriberg [26] considered a set of linguistic structures as segments 
			including the following list: 
			- Complete sentences 
			- Stand-alone sentences 
			- Disfluent sentences aborted in mid-utterance 
			- Interjections 
			- Back-channel responses. 
			In [17], Meteer and Iyer divided speaker utterances into segments, consisting 
			each of a single independent clause. A segment was considered to begin either 
			at the beginning of an utterance, or after the end of the preceding segment. Any 
			dysfluency between the end of the previous segments and the begging of current 
			one was considered part of the current segments. 
			Rott and  
			Cerva [23] aimed to summarize news delivered orally segmenting the 
			transcripts into "something that is similar to sentences". They used a syntactic 
			analyzer to identify the phrases within the text. 
			A wide study focused in unbalanced data for the SBD task was performed 
			by Liu et al. [15]. During this study they followed the segmentation scheme pro- 
			posed by the Linguistic Data Consortium2 on the Simple Metadata Annotation 
			Specification V5.0 guideline (SimpleMDE V5.0) [27], dividing the transcripts in 
			Semantic Units. 
			2 https://www.ldc.upenn.edu/. 
			122 C.-E. Gonz 
			alez-Gallardo and J.-M. Torres-Moreno 
			A Semantic Unit (SU) is considered to be an atomic element of the transcript 
			that manages to express a complete thought or idea on the part of the speaker 
			[27]. Sometimes a SU corresponds to the equivalent of a sentence in written text, 
			but other times (the most part of them) a SU corresponds to a phrase or a single 
			word. 
			SUs seem to be an inclusive conception of a segment, they embrace different 
			previous segment definitions and are flexible enough to deal with the majority 
			of spoken language troubles. For these reasons we will adopt SUs as our segment 
			definition. 
			2.1 Sentence Boundary Evaluation 
			SBD research has been focused on two different aspects; features and methods. 
			Regarding the features, some work focused on acoustic elements like pauses 
			duration, fundamental frequencies, energy, rate of speech, volume change and 
			speaker turn [10,12,14]. 
			The other kind of features used in SBD are textual or lexical features. They 
			rely on the transcript content to extract features like bag-of-word, POS tags or 
			word embeddings [7,12,16,18,23,26,30]. Mixture of acoustic and lexical features 
			have also been explored [1,13,14,32], which is advantageous when both audio 
			signal and transcript are available. 
			With respect to the methods used for SBD, they mostly rely on statisti- 
			cal/neural machine translation [12,22], language models [8,15,18,26], conditional 
			random fields [16,30] and deep neural networks [3,7,29]. 
			Despite their differences in features and/or methodology, almost all previous 
			cited research share a common element; the evaluation methodology. Metrics as 
			Precision, Recall, F1-score, Classification Error Rate and Slot Error Rate (SER) 
			are used to evaluate the proposed system against one reference. As discussed 
			in Sect. 1, further NLP tasks rely on the result of SBD, meaning that is crucial 
			to have a good segmentation. But comparing the output of a system against a 
			unique reference will provide a reliable score to decide if the system is good or 
			bad? 
			Bohac et al. [1] compared the human ability to punctuate recognized spon- 
			taneous speech. They asked 10 people (correctors) to punctuate about 30 min of 
			ASR transcripts in Czech. For an average of 3,962 words, the punctuation marks 
			placed by correctors varied between 557 and 801; this means a difference of 244 
			segments for the same transcript. Over all correctors, the absolute consensus for 
			period (.) was only 4.6% caused by the replacement of other punctuation marks 
			as semicolons (;) and exclamation marks (!). These results are understandable if 
			we consider the difficulties presented previously in this section. 
			To our knowledge, the amount of studies that have tried to target the sentence 
			boundary evaluation with a multi-reference approach is very small. In [1], Bohac 
			et al. evaluated the overall punctuation accuracy for Czech in a straightforward 
			multi-reference framework. They considered a period (.) valid if at least five of 
			their 10 correctors agreed on its position. 
			WiSeBE: Window-Based Sentence Boundary Evaluation 123 
			Kol 
			a 
			r and Lamel [13] considered two independent references to evaluate their 
			system and proposed two approaches. The fist one was to calculate the SER for 
			each of one the two available references and then compute their mean. They 
			found this approach to be very strict because for those boundaries where no 
			agreement between references existed, the system was going to be partially wrong 
			even the fact that it has correctly predicted the boundary. Their second app- 
			roach tried to moderate the number of unjust penalizations. For this case, a 
			classification was considered incorrect only if it didn't match either of the two 
			references. 
			These two examples exemplify the real need and some straightforward solu- 
			tions for multi-reference evaluation metrics. However, we think that it is possible 
			to consider in a more inclusive approach the similarities and differences that mul- 
			tiple references could provide into a sentence boundary evaluation protocol. 
			3 Window-Based Sentence Boundary Evaluation 
			Window-Based Sentence Boundary Evaluation (WiSeBE) is a semi-automatic 
			multi-reference sentence boundary evaluation protocol which considers the per- 
			formance of a candidate segmentation over a set of segmentation references and 
			the agreement between those references. 
			Let R = {R1 
			, R2 
			, ..., Rm 
			} be the set of all available references given a tran- 
			script T = {t1 
			, t2 
			, ..., tn 
			}, where tj 
			is the jth word in the transcript; a reference 
			Ri 
			is defined as a binary vector in terms of the existent SU boundaries in T. 
			Ri 
			= {b1 
			, b2 
			, ..., bn 
			} (1) 
			where 
			bj 
			= 
			1 if tj 
			is a boundary 
			0 otherwise 
			Given a transcript T, the candidate segmentation CT 
			is defined similar to Ri 
			. 
			CT 
			= {b1 
			, b2 
			, ..., bn 
			} (2) 
			where 
			bj 
			= 
			1 if tj 
			is a boundary 
			0 otherwise 
			3.1 General Reference and Agreement Ratio 
			A General Reference (RG 
			) is then constructed to calculate the agreement ratio 
			between all references in. It is defined by the boundary frequencies of each ref- 
			erence Ri 
			 R. 
			RG 
			= {d1 
			, d2 
			, ..., dn 
			} (3) 
			where 
			124 C.-E. Gonz 
			alez-Gallardo and J.-M. Torres-Moreno 
			dj 
			= 
			m 
			i=1 
			tij 
			tj 
			 T, dj 
			= [0, m] (4) 
			The Agreement Ratio (RGAR 
			) is needed to get a numerical value of the dis- 
			tribution of SU boundaries over R. A value of RGAR 
			close to 0 means a low 
			agreement between references in R, while RGAR 
			= 1 means a perfect agreement 
			(Ri 
			 R, Ri 
			= Ri+1 
			|i = 1, ..., m - 1) in R. 
			RGAR 
			= 
			RGP B 
			RGHA 
			(5) 
			In the equation above, RGP B 
			corresponds to the ponderated common boundaries 
			of RG 
			and RGHA 
			to its hypothetical maximum agreement. 
			RGP B 
			= 
			n 
			j=1 
			dj 
			[dj 
			 2] (6) 
			RGHA 
			= m x 
			dj 
			RG 
			1 [dj 
			= 0] (7) 
			3.2 Window-Boundaries Reference 
			In Sect. 2 we discussed about how disfluencies complicate SU segmentation. In a 
			multi-reference environment this causes disagreement between references around 
			a same SU boundary. The way WiSeBE handle disagreements produced by dis- 
			fluencies is with a Window-boundaries Reference (RW 
			) defined as: 
			RW 
			= {w1 
			, w2 
			, ..., wp 
			} (8) 
			where each window wk 
			considers one or more boundaries dj 
			from RG 
			with a 
			window separation limit equal to RWl 
			. 
			wk 
			= {dj 
			, dj+1 
			, dj+2 
			, ...} (9) 
			3.3 W iSeBE 
			WiSeBE is a normalized score dependent of (1) the performance of CT 
			over RW 
			and (2) the agreement between all references in R. It is defined as: 
			WiSeBE = F1RW 
			x RGAR 
			WiSeBE = [0, 1] (10) 
			where F1RW 
			corresponds to the harmonic mean of precision and recall of CT 
			with respect to RW 
			(Eq. 11), while RGAR 
			is the agreement ratio defined in (5). 
			RGAR 
			can be interpreted as a scaling factor; a low value will penalize the overall 
			WiSeBE score given the low agreement between references. By contrast, for a 
			high agreement in R (RGAR 
			 1), WiSeBE  F1RW 
			. 
			WiSeBE: Window-Based Sentence Boundary Evaluation 125 
			F1RW 
			= 2 x 
			precisionRW 
			x recallRW 
			precisionRW 
			+ recallRW 
			(11) 
			precisionRW 
			= bj 
			CT 
			1 [bj 
			= 1, bj 
			 w w  RW 
			] 
			bj 
			CT 
			1 [bj 
			= 1] 
			(12) 
			recallRW 
			= wk 
			RW 
			1 [wk 
			b b  CT 
			] 
			p 
			(13) 
			Equations 12 and 13 describe precision and recall of CT 
			with respect to RW 
			. 
			Precision is the number of boundaries bj 
			inside any window wk 
			from RW 
			divided 
			by the total number of boundaries bj 
			in CT 
			. Recall corresponds to the number 
			of windows w with at least one boundary b divided by the number of windows 
			w in RW 
			. 
			4 Evaluating with W iSeBE 
			To exemplify the WiSeBE score we evaluated and compared the performance 
			of two different SBD systems over a set of YouTube videos in a multi-reference 
			environment. The first system (S1) employs a Convolutional Neural Network to 
			determine if the middle word of a sliding window corresponds to a SU bound- 
			ary or not [6]. The second approach (S2) by contrast, introduces a bidirectional 
			Recurrent Neural Network model with attention mechanism for boundary detec- 
			tion [28]. 
			In a first glance we performed the evaluation of the systems against each 
			one of the references independently. Then, we implemented a multi-reference 
			evaluation with WiSeBE. 
			4.1 Dataset 
			We focused evaluation over a small but diversified dataset composed by 10 
			YouTube videos in the English language in the news context. The selected videos 
			cover different topics like technology, human rights, terrorism and politics with 
			a length variation between 2 and 10 min. To encourage the diversity of content 
			format we included newscasts, interviews, reports and round tables. 
			During the transcription phase we opted for a manual transcription process 
			because we observed that using transcripts from an ASR system will difficult 
			in a large degree the manual segmentation process. The number of words per 
			transcript oscilate between 271 and 1,602 with a total number of 8,080. 
			We gave clear instructions to three evaluators (ref1 
			, ref2 
			, ref3 
			) of how seg- 
			mentation was needed to be perform, including the SU concept and how punctu- 
			ation marks were going to be taken into account. Periods (.), question marks (?), 
			exclamation marks (!) and semicolons (;) were considered SU delimiters (bound- 
			aries) while colons (:) and commas (,) were considered as internal SU marks. 
			The number of segments per transcript and reference can be seen in Table 2. An 
			interesting remark is that ref3 
			assigns about 43% less boundaries than the mean 
			of the other two references.

			4.2 Evaluation 
			We ran both systems (S1 & S2) over the manually transcribed videos obtaining 
			the number of boundaries shown in Table 3. In general, it can be seen that S1 
			predicts 27% more segments than S2. This difference can affect the performance 
			of S1, increasing its probabilities of false positives.

			Table 4 condenses the performance of both systems evaluated against each 
			one of the references independently. If we focus on F1 scores, performance of both 
			systems varies depending of the reference. For ref1 
			, S1 was better in 5 occasions 
			with respect of S2; S1 was better in 2 occasions only for ref2 
			; S1 overperformed 
			S2 in 3 occasions concerning ref3 
			and in 4 occasions for mean (bold). 
			Also from Table 4 we can observe that ref1 
			has a bigger similarity to S1 in 
			5 occasions compared to other two references, while ref2 
			is more similar to S2 
			in 7 transcripts (underline). 
			After computing the mean F1 scores over the transcripts, it can be concluded 
			that in average S2 had a better performance segmenting the dataset compared 
			to S1, obtaining a F1 score equal to 0.510. But... What about the complexity of 
			the dataset? Regardless all references have been considered, nor agreement or 
			disagreement between them has been taken into account. 
			All values related to the WiSeBE score are displayed in Table 5. The Agree- 
			ment Ratio (RGAR 
			) between references oscillates between 0.525 for v8 
			and 0.767 
			for v5 
			. The lower the RGAR 
			, the bigger the penalization WiSeBE will give to 
			the final score. A good example is S2 for transcript v4 
			where F1RW 
			reaches a 
			value of 0.800, but after considering RGAR 
			the WiSeBE score falls to 0.462. 
			It is feasible to think that if all references are taken into account at the same 
			time during evaluation (F1RW 
			), the score will be bigger compared to an average 
			of independent evaluations (F1mean 
			); however this is not always true. That is 
			the case of S1 in v10, which present a slight decrease for F1RW 
			compared to 
			F1mean 
			.

			2 State of the Art 
			The most known RST corpus is the RST Discourse 
			Treebank, for English (Carlson et al., 2002a, 
			2002b). It includes 385 texts of the journalistic 
			domain, extracted from the Penn Treebank 
			(Marcus et al., 1993), such as cultural reviews, 
			editorials, economy articles, etc. 347 texts are used 
			as a learning corpus and 38 texts are used as a test 
			corpus. It contains 176,389 words and 21,789 
			EDUs. 13.8% of the texts (that is, 53) were 
			annotated by two people with a list of 78 relations. 
			For annotation, the annotation tool RSTtool 2 
			(O'Donnell, 2000) was used, with some 
			adaptations. The principal advantages of this 
			corpus stand on the high number of annotated texts 
			(for the moment it is the biggest RST corpus) and 
			the clarity of the annotation method (specified in 
			the annotation manual by Carlson and Marcu, 
			2001). However, some drawbacks remain. The 
			corpus is not free, it is not on-line and it only 
			includes texts of one domain (journalistic). 
			For English there is also the Discourse 
			Relations Reference Corpus (Taboada and 
			Renkema, 2008). This corpus includes 65 texts 
			(each one tagged by one annotator) of several types 
			and from several sources: 21 articles from the Wall 
			Street Journal extracted from the RST Discourse 
			Treebank, 30 movies and books' reviews extracted 
			from the epinions.com website, and 14 diverse 
			texts, including letters, webs, magazine articles, 
			newspaper editorials, etc. The tool used for 
			annotation was also the RSTtool. The advantages 
			of this corpus are that it is free and on-line, and it 
			includes texts of several types and domains. The 
			disadvantages are that the amount of texts is not 
			very high, the annotation methodology is not 
			2 http://www.wagsoft.com/RSTTool/ 
			specified and it does not include texts annotated by 
			several people. 
			Another well-known corpus is the Potsdam 
			Commentary Corpus, for German (Stede, 2004; 
			Reitter and Stede, 2003). This corpus includes 173 
			texts on politics from the on-line newspaper 
			Markische Allgemeine Zeitung. It contains 32,962 
			words and 2,195 sentences. It is annotated with 
			several data: morphology, syntax, rhetorical 
			structure, connectors, correference and informative 
			structure. Nevertheless, only a part of this corpus 
			(10 texts), which the authors name "core corpus", 
			is annotated with all this information. The texts 
			were annotated with the RSTtool. This corpus has 
			several advantages: it is annotated at different 
			levels (the annotation of connectors is especially 
			interesting); all the texts were annotated by two 
			people (with a previous RST training phase); it is 
			free for research purposes, and there is a tool for 
			searching over the corpus (although it is not 
			available on-line). The disadvantages are: the 
			genre and domain of all the texts are the same, the 
			methodology of annotation was quite intuitive 
			(without a manual or specific criteria) and the 
			inter-annotator agreement is not given. 
			For Portuguese, there are 2 corpora, built in 
			order to develop a rhetorical parser (Pardo et al., 
			2008). The first one, the CorpusTCC (Pardo et al., 
			2008), was used as learning corpus for detection of 
			linguistic patterns indicating rhetorical relations. It 
			contains 100 introduction sections of computer 
			science theses (53,000 words and 1,350 sentences). 
			To annotate the corpus a list of 32 rhetorical 
			relations was used. The annotation manual by 
			Carlson and Marcu (2001) was adapted to 
			Portuguese. The annotation tool was the ISI RST 
			Annotation Tool3 , an extension of the RSTtool. 
			The advantages of this corpus are: it is free, it 
			contains an acceptable number of texts and words 
			and it follows a specific annotation methodology. 
			The disadvantage is: it only includes texts of one 
			genre and domain, only annotated by one person. 
			The second one, Rhetalho (Pardo and Seno, 
			2005), was used as reference corpus for the parser 
			evaluation. It contains 50 texts: 20 introduction 
			sections and 10 conclusion sections from computer 
			science scientific articles, and 20 texts from the on- 
			line newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo (7 from the 
			Daily section, 7 from the World section and 6 from 
			3 http://www.isi.edu/~marcu/discourse/ 
			2 
			the Science section). It includes approximately 
			5,000 words. The relations and the annotation tool 
			are the same as those used in the CorpusTCC. The 
			advantages of this corpus are that it is free, it was 
			annotated by 2 people (they both were RST experts 
			and followed an annotation manual) and it contains 
			texts of several genres and domains. The main 
			disadvantage is the scarce amount of texts. 
			The Penn Discourse Treebank (Rashmi et al., 
			2008)f for English includes texts annotated with 
			information related to discourse structure and 
			semantics (without a specific theoretical approach). 
			Its advantages are: its big size (it contains 40,600 
			annotated discourse relations) allows to apply 
			machine learning, and the discourse annotations 
			are aligned with the syntactic constituency 
			annotations of the Penn Treebank. Its limitations 
			are: dependencies across relations are not marked, 
			it only includes texts of the journalistic domain, 
			and it is not free. Although there are several 
			corpora annotated with discourse relations, there is 
			not a corpus of this type for Spanish. 
			3 The RST Spanish Treebank 
			As Sierra (2008) states, a corpus consists of a 
			compilation of a set of written and/or spoken texts 
			sharing some characteristics, created for certain 
			investigation purposes. According to Hovy (2010), 
			we use 7 core questions in corpus design, detailed 
			in the next subsections. 
			3.1 Selecting a Corpus 
			For the RST Spanish Treebank, we wanted to 
			include short texts (finally, the average is 197 
			words by text; the longest containing 1,051 words 
			and the shortest, 25) in order to get a best on-line 
			visualization of the RST trees. Moreover, in the 
			first stage of the project, we preferred to select 
			specialized texts of very different areas, although 
			in the future we plan to include also non- 
			specialized texts (ex. blogs, news, websites) in 
			order to guarantee the representativity of the 
			corpus. We did not find a pre-existing Spanish 
			corpus with these characteristics, so we decided to 
			build our own corpus. Following Cabre (1999), we 
			consider that a text is specialized if it is written by 
			a professional in a given domain. According to this 
			work, specialized texts can be divided in three 
			levels: high (both the author and the potential 
			reader of the text are specialists), average (the 
			author of the text is a specialist, and the potential 
			reader of that text is a student or someone 
			interested in or possessing some prior knowledge 
			about the subject) and low (the author of the text is 
			a specialist, and the potential reader is the general 
			public). The RST Spanish Treebank includes 
			specialized texts of the three mentioned levels: 
			high (scientific articles, conference proceedings, 
			doctoral theses, etc.), average (textbooks) and low 
			(articles and reports from popular magazines, 
			associations' websites, etc.). The texts have been 
			divided in 9 domains (some of them including 
			subdivisions): Astrophysics, Earthquake 
			Engineering, Economy, Law, Linguistics (Applied 
			Linguistics, Language Acquisition, PLN, 
			Terminology), Mathematics (Primary Education, 
			Secondary Education, Scientific Articles), 
			Medicine (Administration of Health Services, 
			Oncology, Orthopedy), Psychology and Sexuality 
			(Clinical Perspective, Psychological Perspective). 
			The size of a corpus is also a polemic question. 
			If the corpus is developed for machine learning, its 
			size will be enough when the application we want 
			to develop obtains acceptable percentages of 
			precision and recall (in the context of that 
			application). Nevertheless, if the corpus is built 
			with descriptive purposes, it is difficult to 
			determine the corpus size. In the case of a corpus 
			annotated with rhetorical relations, it is even more 
			difficult, because there are various factors 
			involved: EDUs, SPANs (that is, a group of related 
			EDUs), nuclearity and relations. In addition, 
			relations are multiple (we use 28). As Hovy (2010: 
			13) mentions, one of the most difficult phenomena 
			to annotate is the discourse structure. Our corpus 
			contains 52,746 words and 267 texts. Table 1 
			includes RST Spanish Treebank statistics in terms 
			of texts, words, sentences and EDUs. 
			Texts Words Sentences EDUs 
			Learning corpus 183 41,555 1,759 2,655 
			Test corpus 84 11,191 497 694 
			Total corpus 267 52,746 2,256 3,349 
			Table 1: RST Spanish Treebank statistics 
			To increase the linear performance of a 
			statistical method, it is necessary that the training 
			corpus size grows exponentially (Zhao et al., 
			2010). However, the RST Spanish Treebank is not 
			designed only to use statistical methods; we think 
			it will be useful to employ symbolic or hybrid 
			3 
			algorithms (combining symbolic and statistical 
			methods). Moreover, this corpus will be dynamic, 
			so we expect to have a bigger corpus in the future, 
			useful to apply machine learning methods. 
			If we measure the corpus size in terms of words 
			or texts, we can take as a reference the other RST 
			corpora. Nevertheless, as Sierra states (2008), it is 
			"absurd" to try to build an exhaustive corpus 
			covering all the aspects of a language. On the 
			contrary, the linguist looks for the 
			representativeness of the texts, that is, tries to 
			create a sample of the studied language, selecting 
			examples which represent the linguistic reality, in 
			order to analyze them in a pertinent way. In this 
			sense and in the frame of this work, we consider 
			that the size will be adequate if the rhetorical trees 
			of the corpus include a representative number of 
			examples of rhetorical relations, at least 20 
			examples of each one (taking into account that the 
			corpus contains 3115 relations, we consider that 
			this quantity is acceptable; however, we expect to 
			have even more examples when the corpus grows). 
			Table 2 shows the number of examples of each 
			relation currently included into the RST Spanish 
			Treebank (N-S: nucleus-satellite relation; N-N: 
			multinuclear relation). As it can be observed, it 
			contains more than 20 examples of most of the 
			relations. The exceptions are the nucleus-satellite 
			relations of Enablement, Evaluation, Summary, 
			Otherwise and Unless, and the multinuclear 
			relations of Conjunction and Disjunction, because 
			it is not so usual to find these rhetorical relations in 
			the language, in comparison with others. Hovy 
			(2010: 128) states that, given the lack of examples 
			in the corpus, there are 2 possible strategies: a) to 
			leave the corpus as it is, with few or no examples 
			of some cases (but the problem will be the lack of 
			training examples for machine learning systems), 
			or b) to add low-frequency examples artificially to 
			"enrich" the corpus (but the problem will be the 
			distortion of the native frequency distribution and 
			perhaps the confusion of machine learning 
			systems). In the current state of our project, we 
			have chosen the first option. We think that, 
			including specialized texts in a second stage, we 
			will get more examples of these less common 
			relations. If we carry out a more granulated 
			segmentation maybe we could obtain more 
			examples; however, we wanted to employ the 
			segmentation criteria used to develop the Spanish 
			RST discourse segmenter (da Cunha et al., 2011).

			3.2 Instantiating the Theory 
			Our segmentation and annotation criteria are very 
			similar to the original ones used by Mann and 
			Thompson (1988) for English, and by da Cunha 
			and Iruskieta (2010) for Spanish. We also explore 
			the annotation manual for English by Carlon and 
			Marcu (2001). Though we use some of their 
			postulates, we think that their analysis is too 
			meticulous in some aspects. Because of this, we 
			consider that it is not adjusted to our interest, 
			which is the finding of the simplest and most 
			objective annotation method, orientated to the 
			4 
			future development of a rhetorical parser for 
			Spanish. To sum up, our segmentation criteria are: 
			a) All the sentences of the text are segmented as 
			EDUs (we consider that a sentence is a textual 
			passage between a period and another period, a 
			semicolon, a question mark or an exclamation 
			point; texts' titles are also segmented). Exs.4 
			[Estas son las razones fundamentales que motivaron 
			este trabajo.] 
			[These are the fundamental reasons which motivated this 
			work.] 
			[Estudio de caso unico sobre violencia conyugal] 
			[Study of a case on conjugal violence] 
			b) Intra-sentence EDUs are segmented, using the 
			following criteria: 
			b1) An intra-sentence EDU has to include a finite 
			verb, an infinitive or a gerund. Ex. 
			[Siendo una variante de la eliminacion Gaussiana,] 
			[posee caracteristicas didacticas ventajosas.] 
			[Being a variant of Gaussian elimination,] [it possesses 
			didactic profitable characteristics.] 
			b2) Subject/object subordinate clauses or 
			substantive sentences are not segmented. Ex. 
			[Se muestra que el modelo discreto en diferencias finitas 
			es convergente y que su realizacion se reduce a resolver 
			una sucesion de sistemas lineales tridiagonales.] 
			[It appears that the discreet model in finite differences is 
			convergent and that its accomplishment is to solve a 
			succession of tridiagonal linear systems.] 
			b3) Subordinate relative clauses are not segmented. 
			Ex. 
			[Durante el proceso, que utiliza solo aritmetica entera, 
			se obtiene el determinante de la matriz de coeficientes 
			del sistema, sin necesidad de calculos adicionales.] 
			[During the process, which only uses entire arithmetic, the 
			determinant of the system coefficient matrix is obtained, 
			without additional calculations.] 
			b4) Elements in parentheses are only segmented if 
			they follow the criterion b1. Ex. 
			[Este ano se cumple el bicentenario del nacimiento de 
			Niels (Nicolas, en nuestro idioma) Henrik Abel.] 
			[This year is the bicentenary of Niels's birth (Nicolas, in 
			our language) Henrik Abel.] 
			b5) Embedded units are segmented by means of 
			the non-relation Same-Unit proposed by Carlon 
			and Marcu (2001). Figure 1 shows this structure. 
			[En decadas precedentes se ha puesto de manifiesto,] [y 
			asi lo han atestiguado muchos investigadores de la 
			4 Spanish examples were extracted from the corpus. English 
			translations are ours. 
			terminologia cientifica serbia,] [una tendencia a 
			importar prestamos del ingles.] 
			[In previous decades it has been shown,] [and it has been 
			testified by many researchers of the scientific Serbian 
			terminology,] [a trend to import loanwords from English.] 
			Figure 1: Example of the non-relation Same-Unit 
			3.3 Designing the Interface 
			The annotation tool used in this work is the 
			RSTtool, since it is free and easy to use. Therefore, 
			we preferred to use it instead of designing a new 
			one. Nevertheless, we have designed an on-line 
			interface to include the corpus and to carry out 
			searches over it (see Section 4). 
			3.4 Selecting and Training the Annotators 
			With regard to the corpus annotators, we have a 
			team of 10 people (last year Bachelor's degree 
			students, Master's degree students and PhDs) 5 . 
			Before the annotation, they took a RST course of 6 
			months (100 hours), where the segmentation and 
			annotation methodology used for the development 
			of the RST Spanish Treebank was explained.6 We 
			called this period "training phase". The course had 
			a theoretical and a practical part. In the theoretical 
			part, some criteria with regard to the 3 phases of 
			rhetorical analysis (segmentation, detection of 
			relations, and rhetorical trees building) were given 
			to annotators. In the practical part, firstly, it was 
			explained how to use the RSTtool. Secondly, 
			annotators extracted several texts from the web, 
			following their personal interests, as for example, 
			music, video games, cookery or art webs. They 
			segmented those texts, using the established 
			segmentation criteria. Once segmented, all the 
			doubts and problematic examples were discussed, 
			and they tried to get an agreement on the most 
			complicated cases. Thirdly, the relations were 
			5 We thank annotators (Adriana Valerio, Brenda Castro, 
			Daniel Rodriguez, Ita Cruz, Jessica Mendez, Josue Careaga, 
			Luis Cabrera, Marina Fomicheva and Paulina De La Vega) 
			and interface developers (Luis Cabrera and Juan Rolland). 
			6 This course was given in the framework of a last-year subject 
			in the Spanish Linguistics Degree at UNAM (Mexico City). 
			5 
			analyzed (using a given relations list) and, once 
			again, annotators discussed the difficult cases. 
			After the discussion, texts were re-annotated to 
			verify if the difficulties were solved. This process 
			was doubly interesting, since it helped to create 
			common criteria for the annotation of the final 
			corpus and to define the annotation criteria more 
			clearly and consensually, in order to include them 
			in the RST Spanish Treebank annotation manual. 
			Once annotators agreed on the most difficult cases, 
			we consider that the training phase finished. 
			3.5 Designing and Managing the Annotation 
			Procedure 
			We start from the following annotation definition: 
			Annotation (`tagging') is the process of adding new 
			information into source material by humans 
			(annotators) or suitably trained machines. [...]. The 
			addition process usually requires some sort of 
			mental decision that depends both on the source 
			material and on some theory or knowledge that the 
			annotator has internalized earlier. (Hovy, 2010: 6) 
			Exactly, after our annotators internalized the 
			theory and annotation criteria during the training 
			phase, the "annotation phase" of the final texts 
			included in the RST Spanish Treebank started. In 
			this phase, the annotation tasks were assigned to 
			annotators (the number of texts assigned to each 
			annotator was different, depending on their 
			availability). They were asked to carry out the 
			annotation individually and without questions 
			among them. We calculated that the average time 
			to carry out the annotation of one text was between 
			15 minutes and 1 hour. This time difference is due 
			to the fact that the corpus includes both short and 
			long texts. The annotation process is the following: 
			once a text is segmented, rhetorical relations 
			between EDUs are annotated. First, EDUs inside 
			the same sentence are annotated in a binary way. 
			Second, sentences inside the same paragraph are 
			linked. Finally, paragraphs are linked. 
			Hovy (2010) states that it is difficult to 
			determine if, for the same money (we add "for the 
			same time"), it is better to double-annotate less, or 
			to single-annotate more. As he explains, Dligach et 
			al. (2010) made an experiment with OntoNotes 
			(Pradhan et al., 2007) verb sense annotation. The 
			result was that, assuming the annotation is stable 
			(that is, inter-annotator agreement is high), it is 
			better to annotate more, even with only one 
			annotator. The problem with RST annotation is 
			that there are so many categories to annotate, that 
			is very difficult to obtain a stable annotation. 
			Therefore, we consider it is necessary to have at 
			least some texts double-annotated (or even triple- 
			annotated), in order to have an adequate discourse 
			corpus. This is the reason why, following the RST 
			Discourse Treebank methodology, we use some 
			texts as learning corpus and some others (from the 
			Mathematics, Psychology and Sexuality domains) 
			as test corpus: 69% (183 texts) and 31% (84 texts), 
			respectively. The texts of the learning corpus were 
			annotated by 1 person, whereas the texts of the test 
			corpus were annotated by 2 people. 
			3.6 Validating Results 
			Da Cunha and Iruskieta (2010) measure inter- 
			annotator agreement by using the RST trees 
			comparison methodology by Marcu (2000). This 
			methodology evaluates the agreement on 4 
			elements (EDUs, SPANs, Nuclearity and 
			Relations), by means of precision and recall 
			measures (an annotation with regard to the other 
			one). Following this methodology, we have 
			measured inter-annotator agreement over the test 
			corpus. We employ an on-line automatic tool for 
			RST trees comparison, RSTeval (Mazeiro and 
			Pardo, 2009), where Marcu's methodology has 
			been implemented (for 4 languages: English, 
			Portuguese, Spanish and Basque). We know that 
			there are some other ways to measure agreement, 
			such as Cohen's kappa (Cohen, 1960) or Fleiss's 
			kappa (Fleiss, 1971), for example. Nevertheless, 
			we consider that Marcu's methodology (2000) is 
			suitable to compare adequately 2 annotations of the 
			same original text, because it has been designed 
			specifically for this task. 
			For each trees pair from the test corpus, 
			precision and recall were measured separately. 
			Afterwards, all those individual results were put 
			together to obtain general results. Table 3 shows 
			global results for the 4 categories. The category 
			with more agreement was EDUs (recall: 91.04% / 
			precision: 87.20%), that is, segmentation. This 
			result was expected, since the segmentation criteria 
			given to the annotators were quite precise and the 
			possibility of mistake was low. The lowest 
			agreement was obtained for the category Relations 
			(recall: 78.48% / precision: 76.81%). This result is 
			lower than the other, but we think it is acceptable. 
			In the RST Discourse Treebank the trend was 
			similar to the one detected in our corpus: the 
			6 
			highest agreement is obtained at the segmentation 
			level and the lowest at the relations level. 
			Category Precision Recall 
			EDUs 87.20% 91.04% 
			SPANs 86% 87.31% 
			Nuclearity 82.46% 84.66% 
			Relations 76.81% 78.48% 
			Table 3: Inter-annotator agreement 
			Precision and recall have not been calculated 
			with respect to a gold standard because it does not 
			exist for Spanish. Our future aim is to reach a 
			consensus on the annotation of the test corpus 
			(using an external "judge"), in order to establish a 
			set of texts considered as a preliminary gold 
			standard for this language. We consider that the 
			annotations have quality at present, because inter- 
			annotator agreement is quite high; however, this 
			consensus could solve the typical annotation 
			mistakes we have detected or some ambiguities. 
			We have analyzed the main discrepancy reasons 
			between annotators. With regard to the 
			segmentation, the main one was human mistake; 
			ex. segmenting EDUs without a verb (one 
			annotator segmented the following passage into 2 
			EDUs because she detected a Means relation, but 
			the second EDU does not include any verb): 
			[Ademas estudiamos el desarrollo de criterios para 
			determinar si un semigrupo dado tiene dicha propiedad ] 
			[mediante el estudio de desigualdades de curvatura- 
			dimension. ] 
			[We also study the development of tests in order to 
			determine if a given semi group has this property] [by means 
			of curvature-dimension inequalities.] 
			The second reason was that in the manual some 
			aspects were not explained in detail. For example, 
			if a substantive sentence or a direct/object clause 
			(which must not be segmented, according to the 
			point b2) includes two coordinated clauses, these 
			must not be segmented either. Thus, we found 
			some erroneous segmentations. For example: 
			[Los hombres adultos tienen miedo de fracasar] [y no 
			cumplir con el rol masculino de ser proveedores del 
			hogar y de proteger a su familia.] 
			[Adult men are scared to fail] [and not to fulfill the 
			masculine role of being the suppliers of the home and to 
			protect their family.] 
			This kind of mistakes allowed us to refine our 
			segmentation manual a posteriori. In the future, we 
			will ask the test corpus annotators to make a new 
			annotation of the texts, using the refined manual, in 
			order to check if the agreement increases, in the 
			same way as the RST Discourse Treebank. 
			With regard to rhetorical annotations, we 
			detected 2 main reasons of inter-annotator 
			disagreement. The first one was the ambiguity of 
			some relations and their corresponding connectors; 
			for example, Justification-Reason, Antithesis- 
			Concession or Circumstance-Means relations, like 
			in the following passage (in Spanish, "al" may 
			indicate time or manner): 
			[Los ninos aprenden matematicas] [al resolver 
			problemas.] 
			[Children learn mathematics] [when solving problems.] 
			The second one is due to differences between 
			annotators when determining nuclearity. For 
			example, in the following passage, one annotator 
			marked Background and the other one Elaboration: 
			[Quedo un hueco en la pared de 60 x 
			1.20cm.]S_Background [Norma y Andres quieren 
			colocar en el hueco una pecera. ]N_Background 
			[Quedo un hueco en la pared de 60 x 
			1.20cm.]N_Elaboration [Norma y Andres quieren 
			colocar en el hueco una pecera. ]S_Elaboration 
			[A hole of 60 x 1.20 cm remained in the wall.] [Norma and 
			Andres want to place a fish tank in the hole.] 
			It is easier to solve segmentation disagreement 
			than relations disagreement, since in this case 
			annotator subjectivity is more evident; we must 
			consider how to refine our manual in this sense. 
			3.7 Delivering and Maintaining the Product 
			Hovy (2010) mentions some technical issues 
			regarding these points: licensing, distribution, 
			maintenance and updates. With regard to licensing 
			and distribution, the RST Spanish Treebank will be 
			free for research purposes. We have a data 
			manager responsible for maintenance and updates. 
			The description of the annotated corpus is also 
			a very important issue (Ide and Pustejovsky, 2010). 
			It is important to provide a high level description 
			of the corpus, including the theoretical framework, 
			the methodology (annotators, annotation manual 
			and tool, agreement, etc.), the means for resource 
			maintenance, the technical aspects, the project 
			leader, the contact, the team, etc. The RST Spanish 
			Treebank includes all this detailed information. 
			XML (with a DTD) has been used, in order the 
			corpus can be reused for several aplications. In the 
			future, we plan to use the standard XCES. 
			7 
			To know more about resources development, 
			linguistic annotation or inter-annotator agreement, 
			we recommend: Palmer et al. (on-line), Palmer and 
			Xue (2010), and Artstein and Poesio (2008). 
			4 The Search Interface of the RST 
			Spanish Treebank 
			The RST Spanish Treebank interface is freely 
			available on-line7. It allows the visualization and 
			downloading of all the texts in txt format, with 
			their corresponding annotated trees in RSTtool 
			format (rs3), as well as in image format (jpg). Each 
			text includes its title, its reference, its web link (if 
			it is an on-line text) and its number of words. The 
			interface shows texts by areas and allows the user 
			to select a subcorpus (including individual files or 
			folders containing several files). The selected 
			subcorpus can be saved on local disk (generating a 
			xml file) for future analyses. 
			The interface includes a statistical tool which 
			allows obtaining statistics of rhetorical relations in 
			a subcorpus selected by the user. The RSTtool also 
			offers this option but it can be only used for one 
			text. We consider that it is more useful for the user 
			to obtain statistics from various texts, in order to 
			get significant statistical results. As the RSTtool, 
			our tool allows to count the multinuclear relations 
			in two ways: a) one unit for each detected 
			multinuclear relation, and b) one unit for each 
			detected nucleus. If we use b), the statistics of the 
			multinuclear relations of Table 2 are higher: List 
			(864), Joint (537), Sequence (289), Contrast (153), 
			Conjunction (28) and Disjunction (24). 
			We are developing another tool, aimed to 
			extract information from the annotated texts, which 
			we will soon include into the interface. This tool 
			will allow to the user to select a subcorpus and to 
			extract from it the EDUs corresponding to the 
			rhetorical relations selected, like a multidocument 
			specialized summarizer guided by user's interests. 
			The RST Spanish Treebank interface also 
			includes a screen which permits the users to send 
			their own annotated texts. Our aim is for the RST 
			Spanish Treebank to become a dynamic corpus, in 
			constant evolution, being increased with texts 
			annotated by users. This has a double advantage 
			since, on the one hand, the corpus will grow and, 
			on the other hand, users will profit from the 
			7 http://www.corpus.unam.mx/rst/ 
			interface's applications, using their own 
			subcorpora. The only requirement is to use the 
			relations and the segmentation and annotation 
			criteria of our project. Once the texts are sent, the 
			RST Spanish Treebank data manager will verify if 
			the annotation corresponds to these criteria. 
			2 State of the Art 
			The most known RST corpus is the RST Discourse 
			Treebank, for English (Carlson et al., 2002a, 
			2002b). It includes 385 texts of the journalistic 
			domain, extracted from the Penn Treebank 
			(Marcus et al., 1993), such as cultural reviews, 
			editorials, economy articles, etc. 347 texts are used 
			as a learning corpus and 38 texts are used as a test 
			corpus. It contains 176,389 words and 21,789 
			EDUs. 13.8% of the texts (that is, 53) were 
			annotated by two people with a list of 78 relations. 
			For annotation, the annotation tool RSTtool 2 
			(O'Donnell, 2000) was used, with some 
			adaptations. The principal advantages of this 
			corpus stand on the high number of annotated texts 
			(for the moment it is the biggest RST corpus) and 
			the clarity of the annotation method (specified in 
			the annotation manual by Carlson and Marcu, 
			2001). However, some drawbacks remain. The 
			corpus is not free, it is not on-line and it only 
			includes texts of one domain (journalistic). 
			For English there is also the Discourse 
			Relations Reference Corpus (Taboada and 
			Renkema, 2008). This corpus includes 65 texts 
			(each one tagged by one annotator) of several types 
			and from several sources: 21 articles from the Wall 
			Street Journal extracted from the RST Discourse 
			Treebank, 30 movies and books' reviews extracted 
			from the epinions.com website, and 14 diverse 
			texts, including letters, webs, magazine articles, 
			newspaper editorials, etc. The tool used for 
			annotation was also the RSTtool. The advantages 
			of this corpus are that it is free and on-line, and it 
			includes texts of several types and domains. The 
			disadvantages are that the amount of texts is not 
			very high, the annotation methodology is not 
			2 http://www.wagsoft.com/RSTTool/ 
			specified and it does not include texts annotated by 
			several people. 
			Another well-known corpus is the Potsdam 
			Commentary Corpus, for German (Stede, 2004; 
			Reitter and Stede, 2003). This corpus includes 173 
			texts on politics from the on-line newspaper 
			Markische Allgemeine Zeitung. It contains 32,962 
			words and 2,195 sentences. It is annotated with 
			several data: morphology, syntax, rhetorical 
			structure, connectors, correference and informative 
			structure. Nevertheless, only a part of this corpus 
			(10 texts), which the authors name "core corpus", 
			is annotated with all this information. The texts 
			were annotated with the RSTtool. This corpus has 
			several advantages: it is annotated at different 
			levels (the annotation of connectors is especially 
			interesting); all the texts were annotated by two 
			people (with a previous RST training phase); it is 
			free for research purposes, and there is a tool for 
			searching over the corpus (although it is not 
			available on-line). The disadvantages are: the 
			genre and domain of all the texts are the same, the 
			methodology of annotation was quite intuitive 
			(without a manual or specific criteria) and the 
			inter-annotator agreement is not given. 
			For Portuguese, there are 2 corpora, built in 
			order to develop a rhetorical parser (Pardo et al., 
			2008). The first one, the CorpusTCC (Pardo et al., 
			2008), was used as learning corpus for detection of 
			linguistic patterns indicating rhetorical relations. It 
			contains 100 introduction sections of computer 
			science theses (53,000 words and 1,350 sentences). 
			To annotate the corpus a list of 32 rhetorical 
			relations was used. The annotation manual by 
			Carlson and Marcu (2001) was adapted to 
			Portuguese. The annotation tool was the ISI RST 
			Annotation Tool3 , an extension of the RSTtool. 
			The advantages of this corpus are: it is free, it 
			contains an acceptable number of texts and words 
			and it follows a specific annotation methodology. 
			The disadvantage is: it only includes texts of one 
			genre and domain, only annotated by one person. 
			The second one, Rhetalho (Pardo and Seno, 
			2005), was used as reference corpus for the parser 
			evaluation. It contains 50 texts: 20 introduction 
			sections and 10 conclusion sections from computer 
			science scientific articles, and 20 texts from the on- 
			line newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo (7 from the 
			Daily section, 7 from the World section and 6 from 
			3 http://www.isi.edu/~marcu/discourse/ 
			2 
			the Science section). It includes approximately 
			5,000 words. The relations and the annotation tool 
			are the same as those used in the CorpusTCC. The 
			advantages of this corpus are that it is free, it was 
			annotated by 2 people (they both were RST experts 
			and followed an annotation manual) and it contains 
			texts of several genres and domains. The main 
			disadvantage is the scarce amount of texts. 
			The Penn Discourse Treebank (Rashmi et al., 
			2008)f for English includes texts annotated with 
			information related to discourse structure and 
			semantics (without a specific theoretical approach). 
			Its advantages are: its big size (it contains 40,600 
			annotated discourse relations) allows to apply 
			machine learning, and the discourse annotations 
			are aligned with the syntactic constituency 
			annotations of the Penn Treebank. Its limitations 
			are: dependencies across relations are not marked, 
			it only includes texts of the journalistic domain, 
			and it is not free. Although there are several 
			corpora annotated with discourse relations, there is 
			not a corpus of this type for Spanish. 
			3 The RST Spanish Treebank 
			As Sierra (2008) states, a corpus consists of a 
			compilation of a set of written and/or spoken texts 
			sharing some characteristics, created for certain 
			investigation purposes. According to Hovy (2010), 
			we use 7 core questions in corpus design, detailed 
			in the next subsections. 
			3.1 Selecting a Corpus 
			For the RST Spanish Treebank, we wanted to 
			include short texts (finally, the average is 197 
			words by text; the longest containing 1,051 words 
			and the shortest, 25) in order to get a best on-line 
			visualization of the RST trees. Moreover, in the 
			first stage of the project, we preferred to select 
			specialized texts of very different areas, although 
			in the future we plan to include also non- 
			specialized texts (ex. blogs, news, websites) in 
			order to guarantee the representativity of the 
			corpus. We did not find a pre-existing Spanish 
			corpus with these characteristics, so we decided to 
			build our own corpus. Following Cabre (1999), we 
			consider that a text is specialized if it is written by 
			a professional in a given domain. According to this 
			work, specialized texts can be divided in three 
			levels: high (both the author and the potential 
			reader of the text are specialists), average (the 
			author of the text is a specialist, and the potential 
			reader of that text is a student or someone 
			interested in or possessing some prior knowledge 
			about the subject) and low (the author of the text is 
			a specialist, and the potential reader is the general 
			public). The RST Spanish Treebank includes 
			specialized texts of the three mentioned levels: 
			high (scientific articles, conference proceedings, 
			doctoral theses, etc.), average (textbooks) and low 
			(articles and reports from popular magazines, 
			associations' websites, etc.). The texts have been 
			divided in 9 domains (some of them including 
			subdivisions): Astrophysics, Earthquake 
			Engineering, Economy, Law, Linguistics (Applied 
			Linguistics, Language Acquisition, PLN, 
			Terminology), Mathematics (Primary Education, 
			Secondary Education, Scientific Articles), 
			Medicine (Administration of Health Services, 
			Oncology, Orthopedy), Psychology and Sexuality 
			(Clinical Perspective, Psychological Perspective). 
			The size of a corpus is also a polemic question. 
			If the corpus is developed for machine learning, its 
			size will be enough when the application we want 
			to develop obtains acceptable percentages of 
			precision and recall (in the context of that 
			application). Nevertheless, if the corpus is built 
			with descriptive purposes, it is difficult to 
			determine the corpus size. In the case of a corpus 
			annotated with rhetorical relations, it is even more 
			difficult, because there are various factors 
			involved: EDUs, SPANs (that is, a group of related 
			EDUs), nuclearity and relations. In addition, 
			relations are multiple (we use 28). As Hovy (2010: 
			13) mentions, one of the most difficult phenomena 
			to annotate is the discourse structure. Our corpus 
			contains 52,746 words and 267 texts. Table 1 
			includes RST Spanish Treebank statistics in terms 
			of texts, words, sentences and EDUs. 
			Texts Words Sentences EDUs 
			Learning corpus 183 41,555 1,759 2,655 
			Test corpus 84 11,191 497 694 
			Total corpus 267 52,746 2,256 3,349 
			Table 1: RST Spanish Treebank statistics 
			To increase the linear performance of a 
			statistical method, it is necessary that the training 
			corpus size grows exponentially (Zhao et al., 
			2010). However, the RST Spanish Treebank is not 
			designed only to use statistical methods; we think 
			it will be useful to employ symbolic or hybrid 
			3 
			algorithms (combining symbolic and statistical 
			methods). Moreover, this corpus will be dynamic, 
			so we expect to have a bigger corpus in the future, 
			useful to apply machine learning methods. 
			If we measure the corpus size in terms of words 
			or texts, we can take as a reference the other RST 
			corpora. Nevertheless, as Sierra states (2008), it is 
			"absurd" to try to build an exhaustive corpus 
			covering all the aspects of a language. On the 
			contrary, the linguist looks for the 
			representativeness of the texts, that is, tries to 
			create a sample of the studied language, selecting 
			examples which represent the linguistic reality, in 
			order to analyze them in a pertinent way. In this 
			sense and in the frame of this work, we consider 
			that the size will be adequate if the rhetorical trees 
			of the corpus include a representative number of 
			examples of rhetorical relations, at least 20 
			examples of each one (taking into account that the 
			corpus contains 3115 relations, we consider that 
			this quantity is acceptable; however, we expect to 
			have even more examples when the corpus grows). 
			Table 2 shows the number of examples of each 
			relation currently included into the RST Spanish 
			Treebank (N-S: nucleus-satellite relation; N-N: 
			multinuclear relation). As it can be observed, it 
			contains more than 20 examples of most of the 
			relations. The exceptions are the nucleus-satellite 
			relations of Enablement, Evaluation, Summary, 
			Otherwise and Unless, and the multinuclear 
			relations of Conjunction and Disjunction, because 
			it is not so usual to find these rhetorical relations in 
			the language, in comparison with others. Hovy 
			(2010: 128) states that, given the lack of examples 
			in the corpus, there are 2 possible strategies: a) to 
			leave the corpus as it is, with few or no examples 
			of some cases (but the problem will be the lack of 
			training examples for machine learning systems), 
			or b) to add low-frequency examples artificially to 
			"enrich" the corpus (but the problem will be the 
			distortion of the native frequency distribution and 
			perhaps the confusion of machine learning 
			systems). In the current state of our project, we 
			have chosen the first option. We think that, 
			including specialized texts in a second stage, we 
			will get more examples of these less common 
			relations. If we carry out a more granulated 
			segmentation maybe we could obtain more 
			examples; however, we wanted to employ the 
			segmentation criteria used to develop the Spanish 
			RST discourse segmenter (da Cunha et al., 2011).

			3.2 Instantiating the Theory 
			Our segmentation and annotation criteria are very 
			similar to the original ones used by Mann and 
			Thompson (1988) for English, and by da Cunha 
			and Iruskieta (2010) for Spanish. We also explore 
			the annotation manual for English by Carlon and 
			Marcu (2001). Though we use some of their 
			postulates, we think that their analysis is too 
			meticulous in some aspects. Because of this, we 
			consider that it is not adjusted to our interest, 
			which is the finding of the simplest and most 
			objective annotation method, orientated to the 
			4 
			future development of a rhetorical parser for 
			Spanish. To sum up, our segmentation criteria are: 
			a) All the sentences of the text are segmented as 
			EDUs (we consider that a sentence is a textual 
			passage between a period and another period, a 
			semicolon, a question mark or an exclamation 
			point; texts' titles are also segmented). Exs.4 
			[Estas son las razones fundamentales que motivaron 
			este trabajo.] 
			[These are the fundamental reasons which motivated this 
			work.] 
			[Estudio de caso unico sobre violencia conyugal] 
			[Study of a case on conjugal violence] 
			b) Intra-sentence EDUs are segmented, using the 
			following criteria: 
			b1) An intra-sentence EDU has to include a finite 
			verb, an infinitive or a gerund. Ex. 
			[Siendo una variante de la eliminacion Gaussiana,] 
			[posee caracteristicas didacticas ventajosas.] 
			[Being a variant of Gaussian elimination,] [it possesses 
			didactic profitable characteristics.] 
			b2) Subject/object subordinate clauses or 
			substantive sentences are not segmented. Ex. 
			[Se muestra que el modelo discreto en diferencias finitas 
			es convergente y que su realizacion se reduce a resolver 
			una sucesion de sistemas lineales tridiagonales.] 
			[It appears that the discreet model in finite differences is 
			convergent and that its accomplishment is to solve a 
			succession of tridiagonal linear systems.] 
			b3) Subordinate relative clauses are not segmented. 
			Ex. 
			[Durante el proceso, que utiliza solo aritmetica entera, 
			se obtiene el determinante de la matriz de coeficientes 
			del sistema, sin necesidad de calculos adicionales.] 
			[During the process, which only uses entire arithmetic, the 
			determinant of the system coefficient matrix is obtained, 
			without additional calculations.] 
			b4) Elements in parentheses are only segmented if 
			they follow the criterion b1. Ex. 
			[Este ano se cumple el bicentenario del nacimiento de 
			Niels (Nicolas, en nuestro idioma) Henrik Abel.] 
			[This year is the bicentenary of Niels's birth (Nicolas, in 
			our language) Henrik Abel.] 
			b5) Embedded units are segmented by means of 
			the non-relation Same-Unit proposed by Carlon 
			and Marcu (2001). Figure 1 shows this structure. 
			[En decadas precedentes se ha puesto de manifiesto,] [y 
			asi lo han atestiguado muchos investigadores de la 
			4 Spanish examples were extracted from the corpus. English 
			translations are ours. 
			terminologia cientifica serbia,] [una tendencia a 
			importar prestamos del ingles.] 
			[In previous decades it has been shown,] [and it has been 
			testified by many researchers of the scientific Serbian 
			terminology,] [a trend to import loanwords from English.] 
			Figure 1: Example of the non-relation Same-Unit 
			3.3 Designing the Interface 
			The annotation tool used in this work is the 
			RSTtool, since it is free and easy to use. Therefore, 
			we preferred to use it instead of designing a new 
			one. Nevertheless, we have designed an on-line 
			interface to include the corpus and to carry out 
			searches over it (see Section 4). 
			3.4 Selecting and Training the Annotators 
			With regard to the corpus annotators, we have a 
			team of 10 people (last year Bachelor's degree 
			students, Master's degree students and PhDs) 5 . 
			Before the annotation, they took a RST course of 6 
			months (100 hours), where the segmentation and 
			annotation methodology used for the development 
			of the RST Spanish Treebank was explained.6 We 
			called this period "training phase". The course had 
			a theoretical and a practical part. In the theoretical 
			part, some criteria with regard to the 3 phases of 
			rhetorical analysis (segmentation, detection of 
			relations, and rhetorical trees building) were given 
			to annotators. In the practical part, firstly, it was 
			explained how to use the RSTtool. Secondly, 
			annotators extracted several texts from the web, 
			following their personal interests, as for example, 
			music, video games, cookery or art webs. They 
			segmented those texts, using the established 
			segmentation criteria. Once segmented, all the 
			doubts and problematic examples were discussed, 
			and they tried to get an agreement on the most 
			complicated cases. Thirdly, the relations were 
			5 We thank annotators (Adriana Valerio, Brenda Castro, 
			Daniel Rodriguez, Ita Cruz, Jessica Mendez, Josue Careaga, 
			Luis Cabrera, Marina Fomicheva and Paulina De La Vega) 
			and interface developers (Luis Cabrera and Juan Rolland). 
			6 This course was given in the framework of a last-year subject 
			in the Spanish Linguistics Degree at UNAM (Mexico City). 
			5 
			analyzed (using a given relations list) and, once 
			again, annotators discussed the difficult cases. 
			After the discussion, texts were re-annotated to 
			verify if the difficulties were solved. This process 
			was doubly interesting, since it helped to create 
			common criteria for the annotation of the final 
			corpus and to define the annotation criteria more 
			clearly and consensually, in order to include them 
			in the RST Spanish Treebank annotation manual. 
			Once annotators agreed on the most difficult cases, 
			we consider that the training phase finished. 
			3.5 Designing and Managing the Annotation 
			Procedure 
			We start from the following annotation definition: 
			Annotation (`tagging') is the process of adding new 
			information into source material by humans 
			(annotators) or suitably trained machines. [...]. The 
			addition process usually requires some sort of 
			mental decision that depends both on the source 
			material and on some theory or knowledge that the 
			annotator has internalized earlier. (Hovy, 2010: 6) 
			Exactly, after our annotators internalized the 
			theory and annotation criteria during the training 
			phase, the "annotation phase" of the final texts 
			included in the RST Spanish Treebank started. In 
			this phase, the annotation tasks were assigned to 
			annotators (the number of texts assigned to each 
			annotator was different, depending on their 
			availability). They were asked to carry out the 
			annotation individually and without questions 
			among them. We calculated that the average time 
			to carry out the annotation of one text was between 
			15 minutes and 1 hour. This time difference is due 
			to the fact that the corpus includes both short and 
			long texts. The annotation process is the following: 
			once a text is segmented, rhetorical relations 
			between EDUs are annotated. First, EDUs inside 
			the same sentence are annotated in a binary way. 
			Second, sentences inside the same paragraph are 
			linked. Finally, paragraphs are linked. 
			Hovy (2010) states that it is difficult to 
			determine if, for the same money (we add "for the 
			same time"), it is better to double-annotate less, or 
			to single-annotate more. As he explains, Dligach et 
			al. (2010) made an experiment with OntoNotes 
			(Pradhan et al., 2007) verb sense annotation. The 
			result was that, assuming the annotation is stable 
			(that is, inter-annotator agreement is high), it is 
			better to annotate more, even with only one 
			annotator. The problem with RST annotation is 
			that there are so many categories to annotate, that 
			is very difficult to obtain a stable annotation. 
			Therefore, we consider it is necessary to have at 
			least some texts double-annotated (or even triple- 
			annotated), in order to have an adequate discourse 
			corpus. This is the reason why, following the RST 
			Discourse Treebank methodology, we use some 
			texts as learning corpus and some others (from the 
			Mathematics, Psychology and Sexuality domains) 
			as test corpus: 69% (183 texts) and 31% (84 texts), 
			respectively. The texts of the learning corpus were 
			annotated by 1 person, whereas the texts of the test 
			corpus were annotated by 2 people. 
			3.6 Validating Results 
			Da Cunha and Iruskieta (2010) measure inter- 
			annotator agreement by using the RST trees 
			comparison methodology by Marcu (2000). This 
			methodology evaluates the agreement on 4 
			elements (EDUs, SPANs, Nuclearity and 
			Relations), by means of precision and recall 
			measures (an annotation with regard to the other 
			one). Following this methodology, we have 
			measured inter-annotator agreement over the test 
			corpus. We employ an on-line automatic tool for 
			RST trees comparison, RSTeval (Mazeiro and 
			Pardo, 2009), where Marcu's methodology has 
			been implemented (for 4 languages: English, 
			Portuguese, Spanish and Basque). We know that 
			there are some other ways to measure agreement, 
			such as Cohen's kappa (Cohen, 1960) or Fleiss's 
			kappa (Fleiss, 1971), for example. Nevertheless, 
			we consider that Marcu's methodology (2000) is 
			suitable to compare adequately 2 annotations of the 
			same original text, because it has been designed 
			specifically for this task. 
			For each trees pair from the test corpus, 
			precision and recall were measured separately. 
			Afterwards, all those individual results were put 
			together to obtain general results. Table 3 shows 
			global results for the 4 categories. The category 
			with more agreement was EDUs (recall: 91.04% / 
			precision: 87.20%), that is, segmentation. This 
			result was expected, since the segmentation criteria 
			given to the annotators were quite precise and the 
			possibility of mistake was low. The lowest 
			agreement was obtained for the category Relations 
			(recall: 78.48% / precision: 76.81%). This result is 
			lower than the other, but we think it is acceptable. 
			In the RST Discourse Treebank the trend was 
			similar to the one detected in our corpus: the 
			6 
			highest agreement is obtained at the segmentation 
			level and the lowest at the relations level. 
			Category Precision Recall 
			EDUs 87.20% 91.04% 
			SPANs 86% 87.31% 
			Nuclearity 82.46% 84.66% 
			Relations 76.81% 78.48% 
			Table 3: Inter-annotator agreement 
			Precision and recall have not been calculated 
			with respect to a gold standard because it does not 
			exist for Spanish. Our future aim is to reach a 
			consensus on the annotation of the test corpus 
			(using an external "judge"), in order to establish a 
			set of texts considered as a preliminary gold 
			standard for this language. We consider that the 
			annotations have quality at present, because inter- 
			annotator agreement is quite high; however, this 
			consensus could solve the typical annotation 
			mistakes we have detected or some ambiguities. 
			We have analyzed the main discrepancy reasons 
			between annotators. With regard to the 
			segmentation, the main one was human mistake; 
			ex. segmenting EDUs without a verb (one 
			annotator segmented the following passage into 2 
			EDUs because she detected a Means relation, but 
			the second EDU does not include any verb): 
			[Ademas estudiamos el desarrollo de criterios para 
			determinar si un semigrupo dado tiene dicha propiedad ] 
			[mediante el estudio de desigualdades de curvatura- 
			dimension. ] 
			[We also study the development of tests in order to 
			determine if a given semi group has this property] [by means 
			of curvature-dimension inequalities.] 
			The second reason was that in the manual some 
			aspects were not explained in detail. For example, 
			if a substantive sentence or a direct/object clause 
			(which must not be segmented, according to the 
			point b2) includes two coordinated clauses, these 
			must not be segmented either. Thus, we found 
			some erroneous segmentations. For example: 
			[Los hombres adultos tienen miedo de fracasar] [y no 
			cumplir con el rol masculino de ser proveedores del 
			hogar y de proteger a su familia.] 
			[Adult men are scared to fail] [and not to fulfill the 
			masculine role of being the suppliers of the home and to 
			protect their family.] 
			This kind of mistakes allowed us to refine our 
			segmentation manual a posteriori. In the future, we 
			will ask the test corpus annotators to make a new 
			annotation of the texts, using the refined manual, in 
			order to check if the agreement increases, in the 
			same way as the RST Discourse Treebank. 
			With regard to rhetorical annotations, we 
			detected 2 main reasons of inter-annotator 
			disagreement. The first one was the ambiguity of 
			some relations and their corresponding connectors; 
			for example, Justification-Reason, Antithesis- 
			Concession or Circumstance-Means relations, like 
			in the following passage (in Spanish, "al" may 
			indicate time or manner): 
			[Los ninos aprenden matematicas] [al resolver 
			problemas.] 
			[Children learn mathematics] [when solving problems.] 
			The second one is due to differences between 
			annotators when determining nuclearity. For 
			example, in the following passage, one annotator 
			marked Background and the other one Elaboration: 
			[Quedo un hueco en la pared de 60 x 
			1.20cm.]S_Background [Norma y Andres quieren 
			colocar en el hueco una pecera. ]N_Background 
			[Quedo un hueco en la pared de 60 x 
			1.20cm.]N_Elaboration [Norma y Andres quieren 
			colocar en el hueco una pecera. ]S_Elaboration 
			[A hole of 60 x 1.20 cm remained in the wall.] [Norma and 
			Andres want to place a fish tank in the hole.] 
			It is easier to solve segmentation disagreement 
			than relations disagreement, since in this case 
			annotator subjectivity is more evident; we must 
			consider how to refine our manual in this sense. 
			3.7 Delivering and Maintaining the Product 
			Hovy (2010) mentions some technical issues 
			regarding these points: licensing, distribution, 
			maintenance and updates. With regard to licensing 
			and distribution, the RST Spanish Treebank will be 
			free for research purposes. We have a data 
			manager responsible for maintenance and updates. 
			The description of the annotated corpus is also 
			a very important issue (Ide and Pustejovsky, 2010). 
			It is important to provide a high level description 
			of the corpus, including the theoretical framework, 
			the methodology (annotators, annotation manual 
			and tool, agreement, etc.), the means for resource 
			maintenance, the technical aspects, the project 
			leader, the contact, the team, etc. The RST Spanish 
			Treebank includes all this detailed information. 
			XML (with a DTD) has been used, in order the 
			corpus can be reused for several aplications. In the 
			future, we plan to use the standard XCES. 
			7 
			To know more about resources development, 
			linguistic annotation or inter-annotator agreement, 
			we recommend: Palmer et al. (on-line), Palmer and 
			Xue (2010), and Artstein and Poesio (2008). 
			4 The Search Interface of the RST 
			Spanish Treebank 
			The RST Spanish Treebank interface is freely 
			available on-line7. It allows the visualization and 
			downloading of all the texts in txt format, with 
			their corresponding annotated trees in RSTtool 
			format (rs3), as well as in image format (jpg). Each 
			text includes its title, its reference, its web link (if 
			it is an on-line text) and its number of words. The 
			interface shows texts by areas and allows the user 
			to select a subcorpus (including individual files or 
			folders containing several files). The selected 
			subcorpus can be saved on local disk (generating a 
			xml file) for future analyses. 
			The interface includes a statistical tool which 
			allows obtaining statistics of rhetorical relations in 
			a subcorpus selected by the user. The RSTtool also 
			offers this option but it can be only used for one 
			text. We consider that it is more useful for the user 
			to obtain statistics from various texts, in order to 
			get significant statistical results. As the RSTtool, 
			our tool allows to count the multinuclear relations 
			in two ways: a) one unit for each detected 
			multinuclear relation, and b) one unit for each 
			detected nucleus. If we use b), the statistics of the 
			multinuclear relations of Table 2 are higher: List 
			(864), Joint (537), Sequence (289), Contrast (153), 
			Conjunction (28) and Disjunction (24). 
			We are developing another tool, aimed to 
			extract information from the annotated texts, which 
			we will soon include into the interface. This tool 
			will allow to the user to select a subcorpus and to 
			extract from it the EDUs corresponding to the 
			rhetorical relations selected, like a multidocument 
			specialized summarizer guided by user's interests. 
			The RST Spanish Treebank interface also 
			includes a screen which permits the users to send 
			their own annotated texts. Our aim is for the RST 
			Spanish Treebank to become a dynamic corpus, in 
			constant evolution, being increased with texts 
			annotated by users. This has a double advantage 
			since, on the one hand, the corpus will grow and, 
			on the other hand, users will profit from the 
			7 http://www.corpus.unam.mx/rst/ 
			interface's applications, using their own 
			subcorpora. The only requirement is to use the 
			relations and the segmentation and annotation 
			criteria of our project. Once the texts are sent, the 
			RST Spanish Treebank data manager will verify if 
			the annotation corresponds to these criteria. 
			2 Cut and paste in summarization 
			2.1 Related work in professional 
			summarizing 
			Professionals take two opposite positions on whether 
			a summary should be produced by cutting and past- 
			ing the original text. One school of scholars is 
			opposed; "(use) your own words... Do not keep 
			too close to the words before you", states an early 
			book on abstracting for American high school stu- 
			dents (Thurber, 1924). Another study, however, 
			shows that professional abstractors actually rely on 
			cutting and pasting to produce summaries: "Their 
			professional role tells abstractors to avoid inventing 
			anything. They follow the author as closely as pos- 
			sible and reintegrate the most important points of 
			a document in a shorter text" (Endres-Niggemeyer 
			et al., 1998). Some studies are somewhere in be- 
			tween: "summary language may or may not follow 
			that of author's" (Fidel, 1986). Other guidelines or 
			books on abstracting (ANSI, 1997; Cremmins, 1982) 
			do not discuss the issue. 
			Our cut and paste based summarization is a com- 
			putational model; we make no claim that humans 
			use the same cut and paste operations. 
			2.2 Cut and paste operations 
			We manually analyzed 30 articles and their corre- 
			sponding human-written summaries; the articles and 
			their summaries come from different domains ( 15 
			general news reports, 5 from the medical domain, 
			10 from the legal domain) and the summaries were 
			written by professionals from different organizations. 
			We found that reusing article text for summarization 
			is almost universal in the corpus we studied. We de- 
			fined six operations that can be used alone, sequen- 
			tially, or simultaneously to transform selected sen- 
			tences from an article into the corresponding sum- 
			mary sentences in its human-written abstract: 
			(1) sentence reduction 
			Remove extraneous phrases from a selected sen- 
			tence, as in the following example 1: 
			1 All the examples in this section were produced by human 
			professionals 
			The deleted material can be at any granularity: a 
			word, a phrase, or a clause. Multiple components 
			can be removed. 
			(2) sentence combination 
			Merge material from several sentences. It can be 
			used together with sentence reduction, as illustrated 
			in the following example, which also uses paraphras- 
			ing: 
			Text Sentence 1: But it also raises serious 
			questions about the privacy of such highly 
			personal information wafting about the digital 
			world. 
			Text Sentence 2: The issue thus fits squarely 
			into the broader debate about privacy and se- 
			curity on the internet, whether it involves pro- 
			tecting credit card number or keeping children 
			from offensive information. 
			Summary sentence: But it also raises the is- 
			sue of privacy of such personal information 
			and this issue hits the head on the nail in the 
			broader debate about privacy and security on 
			the internet. 
			(3) syntactic transformation 
			In both sentence reduction and combination, syn- 
			tactic transformations may be involved. For exam- 
			ple, the position of the subject in a sentence may be 
			moved from the end to the front. 
			(4) lexical paraphrasing 
			Replace phrases with their paraphrases. For in- 
			stance, the summaries substituted point out with 
			note, and fits squarely into with a more picturesque 
			description hits the head on the nail in the previous 
			examples. 
			(5) generalization or specification 
			Replace phrases or clauses with more general or 
			specific descriptions. Examples of generalization 
			and specification include: 
			Generalization: "a proposed new law that 
			would require Web publishers to obtain 
			parental consent before collecting personal in- 
			formation from children" --+ "legislation to 
			protect children's privacy on-line" 
			Specification: "the White House's top drug 
			official" ~ "Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, the 
			White House's top drug official"

			(6) reordering 
			Change the order of extracted sentences. For in- 
			stance, place an ending sentence in an article at the 
			beginning of an abstract. 
			In human-written abstracts, there are, of course, 
			sentences that are not based on cut and paste, but 
			completely written from scratch. We used our de- 
			composition program to automatically analyze 300 
			human-written abstracts, and found that 19% of sen- 
			tences in the abstracts were written from scratch. 
			There are also other cut and paste operations not 
			listed here due to their infrequent occurrence. 
			3 System architecture 
			The architecture of our cut and paste based text 
			summarization system is shown in Figure 1. Input 
			to the system is a single document from any domain. 
			In the first stage, extraction, key sentences in the ar- 
			ticle are identified, as in most current summarizers. 
			In the second stage, cut and paste based generation, a 
			sentence reduction module and a sentence combina- 
			tion module implement the operations we observed 
			in human-written abstracts. 
			The cut and paste based component receives as 
			input not only the extracted key sentences, but also 
			the original article. This component can be ported 
			to other single-document summarizers to serve as 
			the generation component, since most current sum- 
			marizers extract key sentences - exactly what the 
			extraction module in our system does. 
			Other resources and tools in the summarization 
			system include a corpus of articles and their human- 
			written abstracts, the automatic decomposition pro- 
			gram, a syntactic parser, a co-reference resolution 
			system, the WordNet lexical database, and a large- 
			scale lexicon we combined from multiple resources. 
			The components in dotted lines are existing tools or 
			resources; all the others were developed by ourselves. 
			4 Major components 
			The main focus of our work is on decomposition of 
			summaries, sentence reduction, and sentence com- 
			bination. We also describe the sentence extraction 
			module, although it is not the main focus of our 
			work. 
			4.1 Decomposition of human-written 
			summary sentences 
			The decomposition program, see (Jing and McKe- 
			own, 1999) for details, is used to analyze the con- 
			struction of sentences in human-written abstracts. 
			The results from decomposition are used to build 
			the training and testing corpora for sentence reduc- 
			tion and sentence combination. 
			The decomposition program answers three ques- 
			tions about a sentence in a human-written abstract: 
			(1) Is the sentence constructed by cutting and past- 
			ing phrases from the input article? (2) If so, what 
			phrases in the sentence come from the original arti- 
			cle? (3) Where in the article do these phrases come 
			from? 
			We used a Hidden Markov Model (Baum, 1972) 
			solution to the decomposition problem. We first 
			mathematically formulated the problem, reducing it 
			to a problem of finding, for each word in a summary 
			180 
			Summary sentence: 
			(F0:S1 arthur b sackler vice president for law and public policy of time warner inc ) 
			(FI:S-1 and) (F2:S0 a member of the direct marketing association told ) (F3:$2 the com- 
			munications subcommittee of the senate commerce committee ) (F4:S-1 that legislation ) 
			(F5:Slto protect ) (F6:$4 children' s ) (F7:$4 privacy ) (F8:$4 online ) (F9:S0 could destroy 
			the spontaneous nature that makes the internet unique ) 
			Source document sentences: 
			Sentence 0: a proposed new law that would require web publishers to obtain parental consent before 
			collecting personal information from children (F9 could destroy the spontaneous nature that 
			makes the internet unique ) (F2 a member of the direct marketing association told) a 
			senate panel thursday 
			Sentence 1:(F0 arthur b sackler vice president for law and public policy of time warner 
			inc ) said the association supported efforts (F5 to protect ) children online but he urged lawmakers 
			to find some middle ground that also allows for interactivity on the internet 
			Sentence 2: for example a child's e-mail address is necessary in order to respond to inquiries such 
			as updates on mark mcguire's and sammy sosa's home run figures this year or updates of an online 
			magazine sackler said in testimony to (F3 the communications subcommittee of the senate 
			commerce committee ) 
			Sentence 4: the subcommittee is considering the (F6 children's ) (F8 online ) (F7 privacy ) 
			protection act which was drafted on the recommendation of the federal trade commission 
			Figure 2: Sample output of the decomposition program 
			sentence, a document position that it most likely 
			comes from. The position of a word in a document 
			is uniquely identified by the position of the sentence 
			where the word appears, and the position of the word 
			within the sentence. Based on the observation of cut 
			and paste practice by humans, we produced a set of 
			general heuristic rules. Sample heuristic rules in- 
			clude: two adjacent words in a summary sentence 
			are most likely to come from two adjacent words in 
			the original document; adjacent words in a summary 
			sentence are not very likely to come from sentences 
			that are far apart in the original document. We 
			use these heuristic rules to create a Hidden Markov 
			Model. The Viterbi algorithm (Viterbi, 1967) is used 
			to efficiently find the most likely document position 
			for each word in the summary sentence. 
			Figure 2 shows sample output of the program. 
			For the given summary sentence, the program cor- 
			rectly identified that the sentence was combined 
			from four sentences in the input article. It also di- 
			vided the summary sentence into phrases and pin- 
			pointed the exact document origin of each phrase. 
			A phrase in the summary sentence is annotated as 
			(FNUM:SNUM actual-text), where FNUM is the se- 
			quential number of the phrase and SNUM is the 
			number of the document sentence where the phrase 
			comes from. SNUM = -1 means that the compo- 
			nent does not come from the original document. The 
			phrases in the document sentences are annotated as 
			(FNUM actual-text). 
			4.2 Sentence reduction 
			The task of the sentence reduction module, de- 
			scribed in detail in (Jing, 2000), is to remove extra- 
			neous phrases from extracted sentences. The goal of 
			reduction is to "reduce without major loss"; that is, 
			we want to remove as many extraneous phrases as 
			possible from an extracted sentence so that it can be 
			concise, but without detracting from the main idea 
			that the sentence conveys. Ideally, we want to re- 
			move a phrase from an extracted sentence only if it 
			is irrelavant to the main topic. 
			Our reduction module makes decisions based on 
			multiple sources of knowledge: 
			(1) Grammar checking. In this step, we mark 
			which components of a sentence or a phrase are 
			obligatory to keep it grammatically correct. To do 
			this, we traverse the sentence parse tree, produced 
			by the English Slot Grammar(ESG) parser devel- 
			oped at IBM (McCord, 1990), in top-down order 
			and mark for each node in the parse tree, which 
			of its children are obligatory. The main source of 
			knowledge the system relies on in this step is a 
			large-scale, reusable lexicon we combined from mul- 
			tiple resources (Jing and McKeown, 1998). The lexi- 
			con contains subcategorizations for over 5,000 verbs. 
			This information is used to mark the obligatory ar- 
			guments of verb phrases. 
			(2) Context information. We use an extracted 
			sentence's local context in the article to decide which 
			components in the sentence are likely to be most 
			relevant to the main topic. We link the words in the 
			extracted sentence with words in its local context, 
			if they are repetitions, morphologically related, or 
			linked with each other in WordNet through certain 
			type of lexical relation, such as synonymy, antonymy, 
			or meronymy. Each word in the extracted sentence 
			gets an importance score, based on the number of 
			links it has with other words and the types of links. 
			Each phrase in the sentence is then assigned a score 
			181 
			Example 1: 
			Original sentence : When it arrives sometime next year in new TV sets, the V-chip will give 
			parents a new and potentially revolutionary device to block out programs they don't 
			want their children to see. 
			Reduction program: The V-chip will give parents a new and potentially revolutionary device to 
			block out programs they don't want their children to see. 
			Professionals : The V-chip will give parents a device to block out programs they don't want 
			their children to see. 
			Example 2: 
			Original sentence : Sore and Hoffman's creation would allow broadcasters to insert 
			multiple ratings into a show, enabling the V-chip to filter out racy or violent material but leave 
			unexceptional portions o.f a show alone. 
			Reduction Program: Som and Hoffman's creation would allow broadcasters to insert multiple rat- 
			ings into a show. 
			Professionals : Som and Hoffman's creation would allow broadcasters to insert multiple rat- 
			ings into a show. 
			Figure 3: Sample output of the 
			by adding up the scores of its children nodes in the 
			parse tree. This score indicates how important the 
			phrase is to the main topic in discussion. 
			(3) Corpus evidence. The program uses a cor- 
			pus of input articles and their corresponding reduced 
			forms in human-written abstracts to learn which 
			components of a sentence or a phrase can be re- 
			moved and how likely they are to be removed by 
			professionals. This corpus was created using the de- 
			composition program. We compute three types of 
			probabilities from this corpus: the probability that 
			a phrase is removed; the probability that a phrase is 
			reduced (i.e., the phrase is not removed as a whole, 
			but some components in the phrase are removed); 
			and the probability that a phrase is unchanged at 
			all (i.e., neither removed nor reduced). These cor- 
			pus probabilities help us capture human practice. 
			(4) Final decision. The final reduction decision 
			is based on the results from all the earlier steps. A 
			phrase is removed only if it is not grammatically 
			obligatory, not the focus of the local context (indi- 
			cated by a low context importance score), and has a 
			reasonable probability of being removed by humans. 
			The phrases we remove from an extracted sentence 
			include clauses, prepositional phrases, gerunds, and 
			to-infinitives. 
			The result of sentence reduction is a shortened 
			version of an extracted sentence 2. This shortened 
			text can be used directly as a summary, or it can 
			be fed to the sentence combination module to be 
			merged with other sentences. 
			Figure 3 shows two examples produced by the re- 
			duction program. The corresponding sentences in 
			human-written abstracts are also provided for com- 
			parison. 
			2It is actually also possible that the reduction program 
			decides no phrase in a sentence should be removed, thus the 
			result of reduction is the same as the input. 
			sentence reduction program 
			4.3 Sentence combination 
			To build the combination module, we first manu- 
			ally analyzed a corpus of combination examples pro- 
			duced by human professionals, automatically cre- 
			ated by the decomposition program, and identified 
			a list of combination operations. Table 1 shows the 
			combination operations. 
			To implement a combination operation, we need 
			to do two things: decide when to use which com- 
			bination operation, and implement the combining 
			actions. To decide when to use which operation, we 
			analyzed examples by humans and manually wrote 
			a set of rules. Two simple rules are shown in Fig- 
			ure 4. Sample outputs using these two simple rules 
			are shown in Figure 5. We are currently exploring 
			using machine learning techniques to learn the com- 
			bination rules from our corpus. 
			The implementation of the combining actions in- 
			volves joining two parse trees, substituting a subtree 
			with another, or adding additional nodes. We im- 
			plemented these actions using a formalism based on 
			Tree Adjoining Grammar (Joshi, 1987). 
			4.4 Extraction Module 
			The extraction module is the front end of the sum- 
			marization system and its role is to extract key sen- 
			tences. Our method is primarily based on lexical re- 
			lations. First, we link words in a sentence with other 
			words in the article through repetitions, morpholog- 
			ical relations, or one of the lexical relations encoded 
			in WordNet, similar to step 2 in sentence reduction. 
			An importance score is computed for each word in a 
			sentence based on the number of lexical links it has 
			with other words, the type of links, and the direc- 
			tions of the links. 
			After assigning a score to each word in a sentence, 
			we then compute a score for a sentence by adding up 
			the scores for each word. This score is then normal-

			5 Evaluation 
			Our evaluation includes separate evaluations of each 
			module and the final evaluations of the overall sys- 
			tem. 
			We evaluated the decomposition program by two 
			experiments, described in (Jing and McKeown, 
			1999). In the first experiment, we selected 50 
			human-written abstracts, consisting of 305 sentences 
			in total. A human subject then read the decomposi- 
			tion results of these sentences to judge whether they 
			are correct. 93.8% of the sentences were correctly 
			decomposed. In the second experiment, we tested 
			the system in a summary alignment task. We ran 
			the decomposition program to identify the source 
			document sentences that were used to construct the 
			sentences in human-written abstracts. Human sub- 
			jects were also asked to select the document sen- 
			tences that are semantlc-equivalent to the sentences 
			in the abstracts. We compared the set of sentences 
			identified by the program with the set of sentences 
			selected by the majority of human subjects, which is 
			used as the gold standard in the computation of pre- 
			cision and recall. The program achieved an average 
			81.5% precision, 78.5% recall, and 79.1% f-measure 
			for 10 documents. The average performance of 14 
			human judges is 88.8% precision, 84.4% recall, and 
			85.7% f-measure. Recently, we have also tested the 
			system on legal documents (the headnotes used by 
			Westlaw company), and the program works well on 
			those documents too. 
			The evaluation of sentence reduction (see (Jing, 
			2000) for details) used a corpus of 500 sentences and 
			their reduced forms in human-written abstracts. 400 
			sentences were used to compute corpus probabili- 
			ties and 100 sentences were used for testing. The 
			results show that 81.3% of the reduction decisions 
			made by the system agreed with those of humans. 
			The humans reduced the length of the 500 sentences 
			by 44.2% on average, and the system reduced the 
			length of the 100 test sentences by 32.7%. 
			The evaluation of sentence combination module 
			is not as straightforward as that of decomposition 
			or reduction since combination happens later in the 
			pipeline and it depends on the output from prior 
			183 
			Example 1: add descriptions or names for people or organization 
			Original document sentences: 
			"We're trying to prove that there are big benefits to the patients by involving them more deeply in 
			their treatment", said Paul Clayton, Chairman of the Department dealing with comput- 
			erized medical information at Columbia. 
			"The economic payoff from breaking into health care records is a lot less than for 
			banks", said Clayton at Columbia. 
			Combined sentence: 
			"The economic payoff from breaking into health care records is a lot less than for banks", said Paul 
			Clayton, Chairman of the Department dealing with computerized medical information at Columbia.

			Example 2: extract common subjects 
			Original document sentences: 
			The new measure is an echo of the original bad idea, blurred just enough to cloud prospects 
			both for enforcement and for court review. 
			Unlike the 1996 act, this one applies only to commercial Web sites - thus sidestepping 
			1996 objections to the burden such regulations would pose for museums, libraries and freewheeling 
			conversation deemed "indecent" by somebody somewhere. 
			The new version also replaces the vague "indecency" standard, to which the court objected, 
			with the better-defined one of material ruled "harmful to minors." 
			Combined sentences: 
			The new measure is an echo of the original bad idea. 
			The new version applies only to commercial web sites and replaces the vague "indecency" standard 
			with the better-defined one of material ruled "harmful to minors." 
			Professional: 
			While the new law replaces the "indecency" standard with "harmful to minors" and now only 
			applies to commercial Web sites, the "new measure is an echo of the original bad idea." 
			Figure 5: Sample output of the sentence combination program 
			modules. To evaluate just the combination compo- 
			nent, we assume that the system makes the same 
			reduction decision as humans and the co-reference 
			system has a perfect performance. This involves 
			manual tagging of some examples to prepare for the 
			evaluation; this preparation is in progress. The eval- 
			uation of sentence combination will focus on the ac- 
			cessment of combination rules. 
			The overM1 system evMuation includes both in- 
			trinsic and extrinsic evaluation. In the intrinsic evM- 
			uation, we asked human subjects to compare the 
			quality of extraction-based summaries and their re- 
			vised versions produced by our sentence reduction 
			and combination modules. We selected 20 docu- 
			ments; three different automatic summarizers were 
			used to generate a summary for each document, pro- 
			ducing 60 summaries in total. These summaries 
			are all extraction-based. We then ran our sentence 
			reduction and sentence combination system to re- 
			vise the summaries, producing a revised version for 
			each summary. We presented human subjects with 
			the full documents, the extraction-based summaries, 
			and their revised versions, and asked them to com- 
			pare the extraction-based summaries and their re- 
			vised versions. The human subjects were asked to 
			score the conciseness of the summaries (extraction- 
			based or revised) based on a scale from 0 to 10 - 
			the higher the score, the more concise a summary is. 
			They were also asked to score the coherence of the 
			summaries based on a scale from 0 to 10. On aver- 
			age, the extraction-based summaries have a score of 
			4.2 for conciseness, while the revised summaries have 
			a score of 7.9 (an improvement of 88%). The average 
			improvement for the three systems are 78%, 105%, 
			and 88% respectively. The revised summaries are 
			on average 41% shorter than the original extraction- 
			based summaries. For summary coherence, the aver- 
			age score for the extraction-based summaries is 3.9, 
			while the average score for the revised summaries is 
			6.1 (an improvement of 56%). The average improve- 
			ment for the three systems are 69%, 57%, and 53% 
			respectively. 
			We are preparing a task-based evaluation, in 
			which we will use the data from the Summariza- 
			tion EvMuation Conference (Mani et al., 1998) and 
			compare how our revised summaries can influence 
			humans' performance in tasks like text categoriza- 
			tion and ad-hoc retrieval. 
			6 Related work 
			(Mani et al., 1999) addressed the problem of revising 
			summaries to improve their quality. They suggested 
			three types of operations: elimination, aggregation, 
			and smoothing. The goal of the elimination opera- 
			tion is similar to that of the sentence reduction op- 
			184 
			eration in our system. The difference is that while 
			elimination always removes parentheticals, sentence- 
			initial PPs and certain adverbial phrases for every 
			extracted sentence, our sentence reduction module 
			aims to make reduction decisions according to each 
			case and removes a sentence component only if it 
			considers it appropriate to do so. The goal of the 
			aggregation operation and the smoothing operation 
			is similar to that of the sentence combination op- 
			eration in our system. However, the combination 
			operations and combination rules that we derived 
			from corpus analysis are significantly different from 
			those used in the above system, which mostly came 
			from operations in traditional natural language gen- 
			eration. 
			2 Cut and paste in summarization 
			2.1 Related work in professional 
			summarizing 
			Professionals take two opposite positions on whether 
			a summary should be produced by cutting and past- 
			ing the original text. One school of scholars is 
			opposed; "(use) your own words... Do not keep 
			too close to the words before you", states an early 
			book on abstracting for American high school stu- 
			dents (Thurber, 1924). Another study, however, 
			shows that professional abstractors actually rely on 
			cutting and pasting to produce summaries: "Their 
			professional role tells abstractors to avoid inventing 
			anything. They follow the author as closely as pos- 
			sible and reintegrate the most important points of 
			a document in a shorter text" (Endres-Niggemeyer 
			et al., 1998). Some studies are somewhere in be- 
			tween: "summary language may or may not follow 
			that of author's" (Fidel, 1986). Other guidelines or 
			books on abstracting (ANSI, 1997; Cremmins, 1982) 
			do not discuss the issue. 
			Our cut and paste based summarization is a com- 
			putational model; we make no claim that humans 
			use the same cut and paste operations. 
			2.2 Cut and paste operations 
			We manually analyzed 30 articles and their corre- 
			sponding human-written summaries; the articles and 
			their summaries come from different domains ( 15 
			general news reports, 5 from the medical domain, 
			10 from the legal domain) and the summaries were 
			written by professionals from different organizations. 
			We found that reusing article text for summarization 
			is almost universal in the corpus we studied. We de- 
			fined six operations that can be used alone, sequen- 
			tially, or simultaneously to transform selected sen- 
			tences from an article into the corresponding sum- 
			mary sentences in its human-written abstract: 
			(1) sentence reduction 
			Remove extraneous phrases from a selected sen- 
			tence, as in the following example 1: 
			1 All the examples in this section were produced by human 
			professionals 
			The deleted material can be at any granularity: a 
			word, a phrase, or a clause. Multiple components 
			can be removed. 
			(2) sentence combination 
			Merge material from several sentences. It can be 
			used together with sentence reduction, as illustrated 
			in the following example, which also uses paraphras- 
			ing: 
			Text Sentence 1: But it also raises serious 
			questions about the privacy of such highly 
			personal information wafting about the digital 
			world. 
			Text Sentence 2: The issue thus fits squarely 
			into the broader debate about privacy and se- 
			curity on the internet, whether it involves pro- 
			tecting credit card number or keeping children 
			from offensive information. 
			Summary sentence: But it also raises the is- 
			sue of privacy of such personal information 
			and this issue hits the head on the nail in the 
			broader debate about privacy and security on 
			the internet. 
			(3) syntactic transformation 
			In both sentence reduction and combination, syn- 
			tactic transformations may be involved. For exam- 
			ple, the position of the subject in a sentence may be 
			moved from the end to the front. 
			(4) lexical paraphrasing 
			Replace phrases with their paraphrases. For in- 
			stance, the summaries substituted point out with 
			note, and fits squarely into with a more picturesque 
			description hits the head on the nail in the previous 
			examples. 
			(5) generalization or specification 
			Replace phrases or clauses with more general or 
			specific descriptions. Examples of generalization 
			and specification include: 
			Generalization: "a proposed new law that 
			would require Web publishers to obtain 
			parental consent before collecting personal in- 
			formation from children" --+ "legislation to 
			protect children's privacy on-line" 
			Specification: "the White House's top drug 
			official" ~ "Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, the 
			White House's top drug official"

			(6) reordering 
			Change the order of extracted sentences. For in- 
			stance, place an ending sentence in an article at the 
			beginning of an abstract. 
			In human-written abstracts, there are, of course, 
			sentences that are not based on cut and paste, but 
			completely written from scratch. We used our de- 
			composition program to automatically analyze 300 
			human-written abstracts, and found that 19% of sen- 
			tences in the abstracts were written from scratch. 
			There are also other cut and paste operations not 
			listed here due to their infrequent occurrence. 
			3 System architecture 
			The architecture of our cut and paste based text 
			summarization system is shown in Figure 1. Input 
			to the system is a single document from any domain. 
			In the first stage, extraction, key sentences in the ar- 
			ticle are identified, as in most current summarizers. 
			In the second stage, cut and paste based generation, a 
			sentence reduction module and a sentence combina- 
			tion module implement the operations we observed 
			in human-written abstracts. 
			The cut and paste based component receives as 
			input not only the extracted key sentences, but also 
			the original article. This component can be ported 
			to other single-document summarizers to serve as 
			the generation component, since most current sum- 
			marizers extract key sentences - exactly what the 
			extraction module in our system does. 
			Other resources and tools in the summarization 
			system include a corpus of articles and their human- 
			written abstracts, the automatic decomposition pro- 
			gram, a syntactic parser, a co-reference resolution 
			system, the WordNet lexical database, and a large- 
			scale lexicon we combined from multiple resources. 
			The components in dotted lines are existing tools or 
			resources; all the others were developed by ourselves. 
			4 Major components 
			The main focus of our work is on decomposition of 
			summaries, sentence reduction, and sentence com- 
			bination. We also describe the sentence extraction 
			module, although it is not the main focus of our 
			work. 
			4.1 Decomposition of human-written 
			summary sentences 
			The decomposition program, see (Jing and McKe- 
			own, 1999) for details, is used to analyze the con- 
			struction of sentences in human-written abstracts. 
			The results from decomposition are used to build 
			the training and testing corpora for sentence reduc- 
			tion and sentence combination. 
			The decomposition program answers three ques- 
			tions about a sentence in a human-written abstract: 
			(1) Is the sentence constructed by cutting and past- 
			ing phrases from the input article? (2) If so, what 
			phrases in the sentence come from the original arti- 
			cle? (3) Where in the article do these phrases come 
			from? 
			We used a Hidden Markov Model (Baum, 1972) 
			solution to the decomposition problem. We first 
			mathematically formulated the problem, reducing it 
			to a problem of finding, for each word in a summary 
			180 
			Summary sentence: 
			(F0:S1 arthur b sackler vice president for law and public policy of time warner inc ) 
			(FI:S-1 and) (F2:S0 a member of the direct marketing association told ) (F3:$2 the com- 
			munications subcommittee of the senate commerce committee ) (F4:S-1 that legislation ) 
			(F5:Slto protect ) (F6:$4 children' s ) (F7:$4 privacy ) (F8:$4 online ) (F9:S0 could destroy 
			the spontaneous nature that makes the internet unique ) 
			Source document sentences: 
			Sentence 0: a proposed new law that would require web publishers to obtain parental consent before 
			collecting personal information from children (F9 could destroy the spontaneous nature that 
			makes the internet unique ) (F2 a member of the direct marketing association told) a 
			senate panel thursday 
			Sentence 1:(F0 arthur b sackler vice president for law and public policy of time warner 
			inc ) said the association supported efforts (F5 to protect ) children online but he urged lawmakers 
			to find some middle ground that also allows for interactivity on the internet 
			Sentence 2: for example a child's e-mail address is necessary in order to respond to inquiries such 
			as updates on mark mcguire's and sammy sosa's home run figures this year or updates of an online 
			magazine sackler said in testimony to (F3 the communications subcommittee of the senate 
			commerce committee ) 
			Sentence 4: the subcommittee is considering the (F6 children's ) (F8 online ) (F7 privacy ) 
			protection act which was drafted on the recommendation of the federal trade commission 
			Figure 2: Sample output of the decomposition program 
			sentence, a document position that it most likely 
			comes from. The position of a word in a document 
			is uniquely identified by the position of the sentence 
			where the word appears, and the position of the word 
			within the sentence. Based on the observation of cut 
			and paste practice by humans, we produced a set of 
			general heuristic rules. Sample heuristic rules in- 
			clude: two adjacent words in a summary sentence 
			are most likely to come from two adjacent words in 
			the original document; adjacent words in a summary 
			sentence are not very likely to come from sentences 
			that are far apart in the original document. We 
			use these heuristic rules to create a Hidden Markov 
			Model. The Viterbi algorithm (Viterbi, 1967) is used 
			to efficiently find the most likely document position 
			for each word in the summary sentence. 
			Figure 2 shows sample output of the program. 
			For the given summary sentence, the program cor- 
			rectly identified that the sentence was combined 
			from four sentences in the input article. It also di- 
			vided the summary sentence into phrases and pin- 
			pointed the exact document origin of each phrase. 
			A phrase in the summary sentence is annotated as 
			(FNUM:SNUM actual-text), where FNUM is the se- 
			quential number of the phrase and SNUM is the 
			number of the document sentence where the phrase 
			comes from. SNUM = -1 means that the compo- 
			nent does not come from the original document. The 
			phrases in the document sentences are annotated as 
			(FNUM actual-text). 
			4.2 Sentence reduction 
			The task of the sentence reduction module, de- 
			scribed in detail in (Jing, 2000), is to remove extra- 
			neous phrases from extracted sentences. The goal of 
			reduction is to "reduce without major loss"; that is, 
			we want to remove as many extraneous phrases as 
			possible from an extracted sentence so that it can be 
			concise, but without detracting from the main idea 
			that the sentence conveys. Ideally, we want to re- 
			move a phrase from an extracted sentence only if it 
			is irrelavant to the main topic. 
			Our reduction module makes decisions based on 
			multiple sources of knowledge: 
			(1) Grammar checking. In this step, we mark 
			which components of a sentence or a phrase are 
			obligatory to keep it grammatically correct. To do 
			this, we traverse the sentence parse tree, produced 
			by the English Slot Grammar(ESG) parser devel- 
			oped at IBM (McCord, 1990), in top-down order 
			and mark for each node in the parse tree, which 
			of its children are obligatory. The main source of 
			knowledge the system relies on in this step is a 
			large-scale, reusable lexicon we combined from mul- 
			tiple resources (Jing and McKeown, 1998). The lexi- 
			con contains subcategorizations for over 5,000 verbs. 
			This information is used to mark the obligatory ar- 
			guments of verb phrases. 
			(2) Context information. We use an extracted 
			sentence's local context in the article to decide which 
			components in the sentence are likely to be most 
			relevant to the main topic. We link the words in the 
			extracted sentence with words in its local context, 
			if they are repetitions, morphologically related, or 
			linked with each other in WordNet through certain 
			type of lexical relation, such as synonymy, antonymy, 
			or meronymy. Each word in the extracted sentence 
			gets an importance score, based on the number of 
			links it has with other words and the types of links. 
			Each phrase in the sentence is then assigned a score 
			181 
			Example 1: 
			Original sentence : When it arrives sometime next year in new TV sets, the V-chip will give 
			parents a new and potentially revolutionary device to block out programs they don't 
			want their children to see. 
			Reduction program: The V-chip will give parents a new and potentially revolutionary device to 
			block out programs they don't want their children to see. 
			Professionals : The V-chip will give parents a device to block out programs they don't want 
			their children to see. 
			Example 2: 
			Original sentence : Sore and Hoffman's creation would allow broadcasters to insert 
			multiple ratings into a show, enabling the V-chip to filter out racy or violent material but leave 
			unexceptional portions o.f a show alone. 
			Reduction Program: Som and Hoffman's creation would allow broadcasters to insert multiple rat- 
			ings into a show. 
			Professionals : Som and Hoffman's creation would allow broadcasters to insert multiple rat- 
			ings into a show. 
			Figure 3: Sample output of the 
			by adding up the scores of its children nodes in the 
			parse tree. This score indicates how important the 
			phrase is to the main topic in discussion. 
			(3) Corpus evidence. The program uses a cor- 
			pus of input articles and their corresponding reduced 
			forms in human-written abstracts to learn which 
			components of a sentence or a phrase can be re- 
			moved and how likely they are to be removed by 
			professionals. This corpus was created using the de- 
			composition program. We compute three types of 
			probabilities from this corpus: the probability that 
			a phrase is removed; the probability that a phrase is 
			reduced (i.e., the phrase is not removed as a whole, 
			but some components in the phrase are removed); 
			and the probability that a phrase is unchanged at 
			all (i.e., neither removed nor reduced). These cor- 
			pus probabilities help us capture human practice. 
			(4) Final decision. The final reduction decision 
			is based on the results from all the earlier steps. A 
			phrase is removed only if it is not grammatically 
			obligatory, not the focus of the local context (indi- 
			cated by a low context importance score), and has a 
			reasonable probability of being removed by humans. 
			The phrases we remove from an extracted sentence 
			include clauses, prepositional phrases, gerunds, and 
			to-infinitives. 
			The result of sentence reduction is a shortened 
			version of an extracted sentence 2. This shortened 
			text can be used directly as a summary, or it can 
			be fed to the sentence combination module to be 
			merged with other sentences. 
			Figure 3 shows two examples produced by the re- 
			duction program. The corresponding sentences in 
			human-written abstracts are also provided for com- 
			parison. 
			2It is actually also possible that the reduction program 
			decides no phrase in a sentence should be removed, thus the 
			result of reduction is the same as the input. 
			sentence reduction program 
			4.3 Sentence combination 
			To build the combination module, we first manu- 
			ally analyzed a corpus of combination examples pro- 
			duced by human professionals, automatically cre- 
			ated by the decomposition program, and identified 
			a list of combination operations. Table 1 shows the 
			combination operations. 
			To implement a combination operation, we need 
			to do two things: decide when to use which com- 
			bination operation, and implement the combining 
			actions. To decide when to use which operation, we 
			analyzed examples by humans and manually wrote 
			a set of rules. Two simple rules are shown in Fig- 
			ure 4. Sample outputs using these two simple rules 
			are shown in Figure 5. We are currently exploring 
			using machine learning techniques to learn the com- 
			bination rules from our corpus. 
			The implementation of the combining actions in- 
			volves joining two parse trees, substituting a subtree 
			with another, or adding additional nodes. We im- 
			plemented these actions using a formalism based on 
			Tree Adjoining Grammar (Joshi, 1987). 
			4.4 Extraction Module 
			The extraction module is the front end of the sum- 
			marization system and its role is to extract key sen- 
			tences. Our method is primarily based on lexical re- 
			lations. First, we link words in a sentence with other 
			words in the article through repetitions, morpholog- 
			ical relations, or one of the lexical relations encoded 
			in WordNet, similar to step 2 in sentence reduction. 
			An importance score is computed for each word in a 
			sentence based on the number of lexical links it has 
			with other words, the type of links, and the direc- 
			tions of the links. 
			After assigning a score to each word in a sentence, 
			we then compute a score for a sentence by adding up 
			the scores for each word. This score is then normal-

			tion of the person or the organization exists somewhere in the original article but is missing in the 
			summary)) 
			THEN" replace the phrase with the full name plus the full description 
			Rule 2: 
			IF: ((two sentences are close to each other in the original article) and (their subjects refer to the 
			same entity) and (at least one of the sentences is the reduced form resulting from sentence reduc- 
			tion)) 
			THEN: merge the two sentences by removing the subject in the second sentence, and then com- 
			bining it with the first sentence using connective "and".

			The sentences with high scores are considered im- 
			portant. 
			The extraction system selects sentences based on 
			the importance computed as above, as well as other 
			indicators, including sentence positions, cue phrases, 
			and tf*idf scores. 
			5 Evaluation 
			Our evaluation includes separate evaluations of each 
			module and the final evaluations of the overall sys- 
			tem. 
			We evaluated the decomposition program by two 
			experiments, described in (Jing and McKeown, 
			1999). In the first experiment, we selected 50 
			human-written abstracts, consisting of 305 sentences 
			in total. A human subject then read the decomposi- 
			tion results of these sentences to judge whether they 
			are correct. 93.8% of the sentences were correctly 
			decomposed. In the second experiment, we tested 
			the system in a summary alignment task. We ran 
			the decomposition program to identify the source 
			document sentences that were used to construct the 
			sentences in human-written abstracts. Human sub- 
			jects were also asked to select the document sen- 
			tences that are semantlc-equivalent to the sentences 
			in the abstracts. We compared the set of sentences 
			identified by the program with the set of sentences 
			selected by the majority of human subjects, which is 
			used as the gold standard in the computation of pre- 
			cision and recall. The program achieved an average 
			81.5% precision, 78.5% recall, and 79.1% f-measure 
			for 10 documents. The average performance of 14 
			human judges is 88.8% precision, 84.4% recall, and 
			85.7% f-measure. Recently, we have also tested the 
			system on legal documents (the headnotes used by 
			Westlaw company), and the program works well on 
			those documents too. 
			The evaluation of sentence reduction (see (Jing, 
			2000) for details) used a corpus of 500 sentences and 
			their reduced forms in human-written abstracts. 400 
			sentences were used to compute corpus probabili- 
			ties and 100 sentences were used for testing. The 
			results show that 81.3% of the reduction decisions 
			made by the system agreed with those of humans. 
			The humans reduced the length of the 500 sentences 
			by 44.2% on average, and the system reduced the 
			length of the 100 test sentences by 32.7%. 
			The evaluation of sentence combination module 
			is not as straightforward as that of decomposition 
			or reduction since combination happens later in the 
			pipeline and it depends on the output from prior 
			183

			Original document sentences: 
			"We're trying to prove that there are big benefits to the patients by involving them more deeply in 
			their treatment", said Paul Clayton, Chairman of the Department dealing with comput- 
			erized medical information at Columbia. 
			"The economic payoff from breaking into health care records is a lot less than for 
			banks", said Clayton at Columbia.

			Example 2: extract common subjects 
			Original document sentences: 
			The new measure is an echo of the original bad idea, blurred just enough to cloud prospects 
			both for enforcement and for court review. 
			Unlike the 1996 act, this one applies only to commercial Web sites - thus sidestepping 
			1996 objections to the burden such regulations would pose for museums, libraries and freewheeling 
			conversation deemed "indecent" by somebody somewhere. 
			The new version also replaces the vague "indecency" standard, to which the court objected, 
			with the better-defined one of material ruled "harmful to minors." 
			Combined sentences: 
			The new measure is an echo of the original bad idea. 
			The new version applies only to commercial web sites and replaces the vague "indecency" standard 
			with the better-defined one of material ruled "harmful to minors." 
			Professional: 
			While the new law replaces the "indecency" standard with "harmful to minors" and now only 
			applies to commercial Web sites, the "new measure is an echo of the original bad idea." 
			Figure 5: Sample output of the sentence combination program 
			modules. To evaluate just the combination compo- 
			nent, we assume that the system makes the same 
			reduction decision as humans and the co-reference 
			system has a perfect performance. This involves 
			manual tagging of some examples to prepare for the 
			evaluation; this preparation is in progress. The eval- 
			uation of sentence combination will focus on the ac- 
			cessment of combination rules. 
			The overM1 system evMuation includes both in- 
			trinsic and extrinsic evaluation. In the intrinsic evM- 
			uation, we asked human subjects to compare the 
			quality of extraction-based summaries and their re- 
			vised versions produced by our sentence reduction 
			and combination modules. We selected 20 docu- 
			ments; three different automatic summarizers were 
			used to generate a summary for each document, pro- 
			ducing 60 summaries in total. These summaries 
			are all extraction-based. We then ran our sentence 
			reduction and sentence combination system to re- 
			vise the summaries, producing a revised version for 
			each summary. We presented human subjects with 
			the full documents, the extraction-based summaries, 
			and their revised versions, and asked them to com- 
			pare the extraction-based summaries and their re- 
			vised versions. The human subjects were asked to 
			score the conciseness of the summaries (extraction- 
			based or revised) based on a scale from 0 to 10 - 
			the higher the score, the more concise a summary is. 
			They were also asked to score the coherence of the 
			summaries based on a scale from 0 to 10. On aver- 
			age, the extraction-based summaries have a score of 
			4.2 for conciseness, while the revised summaries have 
			a score of 7.9 (an improvement of 88%). The average 
			improvement for the three systems are 78%, 105%, 
			and 88% respectively. The revised summaries are 
			on average 41% shorter than the original extraction- 
			based summaries. For summary coherence, the aver- 
			age score for the extraction-based summaries is 3.9, 
			while the average score for the revised summaries is 
			6.1 (an improvement of 56%). The average improve- 
			ment for the three systems are 69%, 57%, and 53% 
			respectively. 
			We are preparing a task-based evaluation, in 
			which we will use the data from the Summariza- 
			tion EvMuation Conference (Mani et al., 1998) and 
			compare how our revised summaries can influence 
			humans' performance in tasks like text categoriza- 
			tion and ad-hoc retrieval. 
			6 Related work 
			(Mani et al., 1999) addressed the problem of revising 
			summaries to improve their quality. They suggested 
			three types of operations: elimination, aggregation, 
			and smoothing. The goal of the elimination opera- 
			tion is similar to that of the sentence reduction op- 
			184 
			eration in our system. The difference is that while 
			elimination always removes parentheticals, sentence- 
			initial PPs and certain adverbial phrases for every 
			extracted sentence, our sentence reduction module 
			aims to make reduction decisions according to each 
			case and removes a sentence component only if it 
			considers it appropriate to do so. The goal of the 
			aggregation operation and the smoothing operation 
			is similar to that of the sentence combination op- 
			eration in our system. However, the combination 
			operations and combination rules that we derived 
			from corpus analysis are significantly different from 
			those used in the above system, which mostly came 
			from operations in traditional natural language gen- 
			eration.

			Figure 1 presents the context of this work in VOCA- 
			GEN project. Our industrial partner Script&Go1 develop an 
			application for the construction management dedicated to 
			touch devices and wishes to set up an oral dialogue module 
			to facilitate on construction site seizure. The second industrial 
			partner (Tykomz) develops a vocal recognition suite based on 
			toolkit sphynx 4 [1]. This toolkit includes hierarchical agglom- 
			erative clustering methods using well-known measures such as 
			BIC and CLR and provides elementary tools, such as segment 
			and cluster generators, decoder and model trainers. Fitting 
			those elementary tools together is an easy way of developing 
			a specific diarization system. To work, it is necessary to build 
			a model of knowledge, i.e. a model describing the expressions 
			that must be recognized by the program. To improve the 
			performance of the system, this knowledge model must be 
			1http://www.scriptandgo.com/en/ 
			Fig. 1. figure describing the context of the project 
			powered by a domain-specific vocabulary. For example, in the 
			sentence "there is a stain of paint in the kitchen", the system 
			must understand that it is a stain of paint and that the kitchen is 
			a room. To our knowledge, there is no ontology or taxonomy 
			specific to the construction industry in French. A version is 
			under development by [2] but ontology is in English and very 
			generic. We therefore choose to extract useful knowledge from 
			textual data, and then, in a second step, to organize them. 
			III. RELATED WORKS 
			The goal of ontology learning (OL) is to build knowledge 
			models from text. OL use NLP knowledge extraction tools 
			to extract terminology (concepts) and links between them 
			(relationships). The main approaches found in the literature are 
			rule-based systems, statistical or learning based approaches. 
			The reference in the field of rule-based systems was de- 
			veloped by [3]. General Architecture for Text Engineering 
			(GATE) is a Java collection of tools initially developed at the 
			University of Sheffield since 1995. An alternative is offered by 
			the existing semi-automatic ontology learning text2onto [4]. 
			More recently, [5] developed UIMA, a system that can be 
			positioned as an alternative to GATE. Amongst other things, 
			UIMA makes possible to generate rules from a collection of 
			annotated documents. Exit, introduced by [6] is an iterative 
			approach that finds the terms in an incremental way. 
			[7] with TERMINAE is certainly the oldest statistic ap- 
			proach. Developed for French and based on lexical frequen- 
			cies, it requires pre-processing with TermoStat [8] and ANNIE 
			(GATE). [9] presents a method for extracting terminology spe- 
			cific to a domain from a corpus of domain-specific text, where 
			no external general domain reference corpus is required. They 
			present an adaptation of the classic tf-idf as ranking measure 
			and use different filters to produce a specific terminology. 
			More recently, the efficiency of ranking measure like mutual 
			information developed for statistical approach is discussed in 
			[10] and [11]. [12] proposes Termolator a terminology extrac- 
			tion system using a chunking procedure, and using internet 
			queries for ranking candidate terms. Approach is interesting 
			but the authors emphasize the fact that the runtime for each 
			queries is a limiting factor to produce a relevant ranking. 
			Closer to our work, [13] presents an approach combining 
			linguistic pattern and Z-score to extract terminology in the 
			field of nanotechnology. [14] propose TAXI, which combines 
			statistics and learning approach. TAXI is a system for building 
			a taxonomy using 2 corpora, a generic, the other specific. 
			It ranks the relevance of candidates by measure (frequency- 
			based), and by learning with SVM. [15], [16] present TexSIS, 
			a bilingual terminology extraction system with chunk-based 
			alignment method for the generation of candidate terms. After 
			the corpus alignment step, they use an approach combining 
			log likelihood measure and Mutual Expectation measure [17] 
			to rank candidate terms in each language. In the same or- 
			der, [18], [19] present an approach to extract grammatical 
			terminology from linguistic corpora. They compare a series 
			of well-established statistical measures that have been used 
			in similar automatic term extraction tasks and conclude that 
			corpus-comparing methods perform better than metrics that 
			are not based on corpus comparison. [20] and [21] present 
			methods with word embeddings. With a small data set for 
			learning phase, they improve the term extraction results in 
			n-gram terms. However, these papers involve labelled data 
			sets for learning phase, which is the main difference with 
			our proposed approach. The originality of our approach is to 
			combine a lexico-syntactical and a statistical approach while 
			using external resources. 
			IV. RESOURCES AND STATISTICS 
			First experiments were carried out using technical reports 
			collected from some customers from our industrial partners 
			who will be called as NC collection thereafter. Each document 
			contains all the non-compliance that was found on one work 
			site and describe solutions to resolve it. However heterogeneity 
			of the formats as well as the artificial repetition of the informa- 
			tion between two reports found in the same construction site 
			made the term extraction quite difficult. An insightful analysis 
			of those reports reveals vocabulary richness, however, difficult 
			to exploit given numerous misspellings, typing shortcuts, very 
			"telegraphic" style with verbs in the infinitive, little punctu- 
			ation, few determinants, etc. As a consequence, we used a 
			collection of technical specifications called CCTP2. CCTPs are 
			available online on public sector websites3. Several thousand 
			documents were collected by our industrial partner using an 
			automatic web collecting process. Figure 2 presents some key 
			descriptive statistics of theses collections.

			Fig. 3. System overview 
			V. METHODOLOGY 
			A. System Overview 
			Figure 3 presents an overview of the system designed and 
			implemented: steps are further explained in Sections V-B to 
			V-E. In Step 1 pre-processing of raw information extracted 
			from CCTP collection takes place; this is required for nor- 
			malizing the entire set of documents. In Step 2 n-grams are 
			extracted (by using measures). 1,2,3 grams are extracted. In 
			Step 3, n-grams are filtered by using linguistic patterns and 
			Internet queries. Finally, in Step 4 a ranking is applied to the 
			filtered n-grams. 
			B. Normalization, pre-processing and word ngrams extraction 
			In Step 1, a text normalization is performed to improve the 
			quality of the process. We remove special characters such as 
			"/" or "()". Different pretreatments are done to reduce noise 
			in the model: we remove numbers (numeric and/or textual), 
			special symbols. "." are tagged with a special character to 
			not create artificial n-grams. Specific words (including named 
			entities) like company names, dates, etc. are normalized and 
			will be removed in the next module. We do not include a 
			stop list to keep n-grams with prepositions, for the purpose 
			described in the remainder. Then, we tokenize the entire 
			collection before using TreeTagger [22] to get the part-of- 
			speech tags and lemmas of each word. After this step we 
			transform all vocabulary from the CCTP collection into 1- 
			grams, 2-grams and 3-grams. Special characters or normalized 
			words resulting from the previous processing are discarded. N- 
			grams with a very low frequency (2) are also discarded. 
			C. Linguistic patterns module 
			We use grammatical labels generated in the previous step 
			(section V-B) and linguistic patterns to retrieve collocations 
			such as NOUN-NOUN, NOUN-PREP-NOUN. These patterns 
			are frequently found in the literature [6] to capture specific 
			words in French like "carte de cr 
			edit"(credit card) and discard 
			3-gram like 'cr 
			editer sa carte' (credit his card) with the 
			pattern VERB-PREP-NOUN. Among frequent patterns found 
			in literature, those patterns have been selected according to the 
			statistics obtained from a knowledge model of another field 
			(agriculture), given by one of our industrial partners. Figure 
			4 presents main patterns we selected using this knowledge 
			model. The sum of the percentages is less than 100% because 
			Number Percentage 
			1-grams 1360 65.24% 
			NOUN 1037 76.25% 
			VERB 194 14.26% 
			ADJ 120 8.82% 
			2-grams 390 19.57% 
			NOUN-NOUN 346 88.72% 
			ADJ-NOUN 11 2.82% 
			PREP-NOUN 7 1,79% 
			VERB-NOUN 5 1,28% 
			3-grams 188 9.43% 
			NOUN-NOUN-NOUN 150 79.79% 
			PREP-NOUN-NOUN 15 7.98% 
			NOUN-PREP-NOUN 6 3,19% 
			VERB-NOUN-NOUN 6 3,19% 
			Fig. 4. Distribution of linguistic patterns according to the knowledge model. 
			patterns with a very low frequency are not included in the 
			table. We observed that the noun based patterns are the most 
			frequent patterns, whatever the size of the n-gram. The other 
			selected patterns also contain nouns, but they are n-grams 
			with verbs, adjectives or prepositions. Therefore, we have 
			configured our system to keep only the ngrams corresponding 
			to these patterns. 
			D. Pruning step 
			This step uses the Internet to prune n-grams for which no 
			information is returned after querying Bing4 search engine. 
			We count the number of links in the result pages that contain 
			exactly the ngram. We save the number of exact matches 
			between the ngram and the title and snippet of each result. 
			We keep only the n-grams whose number of matches exceeds 
			a defined threshold. We varied this threshold between 1 and 
			50 and results presented in Section VI-B have been obtained 
			with a threshold of 10. 
			E. Ranking step 
			We tested several measures as provided in [6], [16] like 
			maximum likelihood estimation or mutual information in 
			order to rank selected n-grams by quality but results were 
			disappointing. We finally use classical Z score [23] with 
			twenty years of the French newspaper Le Monde5 as generic 
			collection. This metric considers word frequencies weighted 
			over two different corpora, in order to assign high values to 
			words having much higher or lower frequencies than expected 
			in a generic collection. We defined it as follows : 
			p1 
			= a0 
			/b0 (1) 
			p2 
			= a1 
			/b1 (2) 
			4https://www.bing.com/ 
			5http://www.islrn.org/resources/421-401-527-366-2/ 
			p = (a0 
			+ a1 
			)/(b0 
			+ b1 
			) (3) 
			ZS 
			core = 
			p1 
			- p2 
			(p  (1 - p)  ( 1 
			b0 
			+ 1 
			b1 
			) 
			(4) 
			Where a is the lexical unit considered (1-gram, 2-gram or 
			3-gram), a0 the frequency of a in the CCTP collection, b0 the 
			total size in words of CCTP collection, b1 the frequency of a 
			in the collection Le Monde. 
			VI. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS 
			A. Experimental protocol 
			We have made a manual evaluation on all 3 grams retained 
			by the system. Manual evaluation was realized by 6 specialists 
			in the field of construction. Each specialist evaluating one third 
			of the results. 5144 3-grams were evaluated with this method 
			and each n-gram was evaluated by 2 different specialists. 
			For each n-grams, the specialist can choose between three 
			possibilities: 
			* 0 3-gram is irrelevant 
			* 1 3-gram is relevant but does not belong to the domain 
			* 2 3-gram is relevant and belongs to the domain 
			Evaluation was done in two steps and we use Kappa 
			measure6 [24] and inter-annotator agreement at the end of the 
			first step to show the difficulty of the task. At the end of the 
			first step, we obtained a Kappa score of 0.62 and a global 
			inter-annotator agreement of 0.74, which is quite good as 
			explained in [25]. The difficulty of the task was to distinguish 
			the domain-specific vocabulary from the generic vocabulary 
			used in the field of construction. Each disagreement was re- 
			evaluated in the second step by a pair of experts. Figure 5 
			shows the final results of the evaluation. 
			B. Results 
			In this section, we present the results obtained during the 
			manual evaluation of the 3-grams retained by the system. We 
			only compute the accuracy and the error rate, because we are 
			not able to compute the recall for this collection7. We have 
			merged the assessments of each expert using two different 
			evaluation rules: 
			* a strict evaluation where a n-gram is considered correct 
			if both experts have rated it relevant and in the domain . 
			* a flexible evaluation where a n-gram is considered correct 
			if both experts consider it relevant and at least one of the 
			experts consider it in the domain. 
			strict evaluation flexible evaluation 
			accuracy 0.77 0.91 
			error rate 0.23 0.09 
			Fig. 5. Results of manual evaluation on the 3-grams. 
			6We use general formula as follows :  = A0-Ae 
			1-Ae 
			where A0 = observed 
			agreement and Ae = expected (chance) agreement. 
			7Indeed, we do not know every the relevant terms existing in the corpus, 
			so we cannot estimate the recall for the collection of terms we automatically 
			extract. 
			Strict evaluation shows good quality results (0.77). Anal- 
			ysis of the results shows that the main error is related to 
			"incomplete n-grams". For example, the 3-gram "personne 
			 
			a mobilit 
			e" (person with mobility) is not relevant while the 
			4-gram "personne  
			a mobilit 
			e r 
			eduite" (person with reduced 
			mobility ) can belong to the field of construction. Some errors 
			can also be traced back to the CCTP documents. For example, 
			"engin de guerre" (war machine) is a term which does not 
			belong to the field but a law relating to the presence of war 
			machine on the building sites is reported in every CCTP. The 
			flexible evaluation shows very good results (0.91) and the 
			difficulty of assessing class of some terms such as "absence de 
			remise" which has 2 distinct meanings in French (no outhouse 
			and no discount). The first meaning is relevant in the field of 
			construction but not the second.

			V. METHODOLOGY 
			A. System Overview 
			Figure 3 presents an overview of the system designed and 
			implemented: steps are further explained in Sections V-B to 
			V-E. In Step 1 pre-processing of raw information extracted 
			from CCTP collection takes place; this is required for nor- 
			malizing the entire set of documents. In Step 2 n-grams are 
			extracted (by using measures). 1,2,3 grams are extracted. In 
			Step 3, n-grams are filtered by using linguistic patterns and 
			Internet queries. Finally, in Step 4 a ranking is applied to the 
			filtered n-grams. 
			B. Normalization, pre-processing and word ngrams extraction 
			In Step 1, a text normalization is performed to improve the 
			quality of the process. We remove special characters such as 
			"/" or "()". Different pretreatments are done to reduce noise 
			in the model: we remove numbers (numeric and/or textual), 
			special symbols. "." are tagged with a special character to 
			not create artificial n-grams. Specific words (including named 
			entities) like company names, dates, etc. are normalized and 
			will be removed in the next module. We do not include a 
			stop list to keep n-grams with prepositions, for the purpose 
			described in the remainder. Then, we tokenize the entire 
			collection before using TreeTagger [22] to get the part-of- 
			speech tags and lemmas of each word. After this step we 
			transform all vocabulary from the CCTP collection into 1- 
			grams, 2-grams and 3-grams. Special characters or normalized 
			words resulting from the previous processing are discarded. N- 
			grams with a very low frequency (2) are also discarded. 
			C. Linguistic patterns module 
			We use grammatical labels generated in the previous step 
			(section V-B) and linguistic patterns to retrieve collocations 
			such as NOUN-NOUN, NOUN-PREP-NOUN. These patterns 
			are frequently found in the literature [6] to capture specific 
			words in French like "carte de cr 
			edit"(credit card) and discard 
			3-gram like 'cr 
			editer sa carte' (credit his card) with the 
			pattern VERB-PREP-NOUN. Among frequent patterns found 
			in literature, those patterns have been selected according to the 
			statistics obtained from a knowledge model of another field 
			(agriculture), given by one of our industrial partners. Figure 
			4 presents main patterns we selected using this knowledge 
			model. The sum of the percentages is less than 100% because 
			Number Percentage 
			1-grams 1360 65.24%

			2-grams 390 19.57%

			VERB-NOUN-NOUN 6 3,19% 
			Fig. 4. Distribution of linguistic patterns according to the knowledge model. 
			patterns with a very low frequency are not included in the 
			table. We observed that the noun based patterns are the most 
			frequent patterns, whatever the size of the n-gram. The other 
			selected patterns also contain nouns, but they are n-grams 
			with verbs, adjectives or prepositions. Therefore, we have 
			configured our system to keep only the ngrams corresponding 
			to these patterns. 
			D. Pruning step 
			This step uses the Internet to prune n-grams for which no 
			information is returned after querying Bing4 search engine. 
			We count the number of links in the result pages that contain 
			exactly the ngram. We save the number of exact matches 
			between the ngram and the title and snippet of each result. 
			We keep only the n-grams whose number of matches exceeds 
			a defined threshold. We varied this threshold between 1 and 
			50 and results presented in Section VI-B have been obtained 
			with a threshold of 10. 
			E. Ranking step 
			We tested several measures as provided in [6], [16] like 
			maximum likelihood estimation or mutual information in 
			order to rank selected n-grams by quality but results were 
			disappointing. We finally use classical Z score [23] with 
			twenty years of the French newspaper Le Monde5 as generic 
			collection. This metric considers word frequencies weighted 
			over two different corpora, in order to assign high values to 
			words having much higher or lower frequencies than expected 
			in a generic collection. We defined it as follows : 
			p1 
			= a0 
			/b0 (1) 
			p2 
			= a1 
			/b1 (2) 
			4https://www.bing.com/ 
			5http://www.islrn.org/resources/421-401-527-366-2/ 
			p = (a0 
			+ a1 
			)/(b0 
			+ b1 
			) (3) 
			ZS 
			core = 
			p1 
			- p2 
			(p  (1 - p)  ( 1 
			b0 
			+ 1 
			b1 
			) 
			(4) 
			Where a is the lexical unit considered (1-gram, 2-gram or 
			3-gram), a0 the frequency of a in the CCTP collection, b0 the 
			total size in words of CCTP collection, b1 the frequency of a 
			in the collection Le Monde. 
			VI. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS 
			A. Experimental protocol 
			We have made a manual evaluation on all 3 grams retained 
			by the system. Manual evaluation was realized by 6 specialists 
			in the field of construction. Each specialist evaluating one third 
			of the results. 5144 3-grams were evaluated with this method 
			and each n-gram was evaluated by 2 different specialists. 
			For each n-grams, the specialist can choose between three 
			possibilities: 
			* 0 3-gram is irrelevant 
			* 1 3-gram is relevant but does not belong to the domain 
			* 2 3-gram is relevant and belongs to the domain 
			Evaluation was done in two steps and we use Kappa 
			measure6 [24] and inter-annotator agreement at the end of the 
			first step to show the difficulty of the task. At the end of the 
			first step, we obtained a Kappa score of 0.62 and a global 
			inter-annotator agreement of 0.74, which is quite good as 
			explained in [25]. The difficulty of the task was to distinguish 
			the domain-specific vocabulary from the generic vocabulary 
			used in the field of construction. Each disagreement was re- 
			evaluated in the second step by a pair of experts. Figure 5 
			shows the final results of the evaluation. 
			B. Results 
			In this section, we present the results obtained during the 
			manual evaluation of the 3-grams retained by the system. We 
			only compute the accuracy and the error rate, because we are 
			not able to compute the recall for this collection7. We have 
			merged the assessments of each expert using two different 
			evaluation rules: 
			* a strict evaluation where a n-gram is considered correct 
			if both experts have rated it relevant and in the domain . 
			* a flexible evaluation where a n-gram is considered correct 
			if both experts consider it relevant and at least one of the 
			experts consider it in the domain. 
			strict evaluation flexible evaluation 
			accuracy 0.77 0.91 
			error rate 0.23 0.09 
			Fig. 5. Results of manual evaluation on the 3-grams. 
			6We use general formula as follows :  = A0-Ae 
			1-Ae 
			where A0 = observed 
			agreement and Ae = expected (chance) agreement. 
			7Indeed, we do not know every the relevant terms existing in the corpus, 
			so we cannot estimate the recall for the collection of terms we automatically 
			extract. 
			Strict evaluation shows good quality results (0.77). Anal- 
			ysis of the results shows that the main error is related to 
			"incomplete n-grams". For example, the 3-gram "personne 
			 
			a mobilit 
			e" (person with mobility) is not relevant while the 
			4-gram "personne  
			a mobilit 
			e r 
			eduite" (person with reduced 
			mobility ) can belong to the field of construction. Some errors 
			can also be traced back to the CCTP documents. For example, 
			"engin de guerre" (war machine) is a term which does not 
			belong to the field but a law relating to the presence of war 
			machine on the building sites is reported in every CCTP. The 
			flexible evaluation shows very good results (0.91) and the 
			difficulty of assessing class of some terms such as "absence de 
			remise" which has 2 distinct meanings in French (no outhouse 
			and no discount). The first meaning is relevant in the field of 
			construction but not the second. 
			II. RELATED WORKS 
			The main characteristic of the approach presented in this 
			paper is to only have to provide the labels of the classes to 
			be predicted. This method does not need to have a tagged 
			data set to predict the different classes, so it is closer to an 
			unsupervised (clustering) or semi-supervised learning method 
			than a supervised. The main idea of clustering is to group 
			untagged data into a number of clusters, such that similar ex- 
			amples are grouped together and different ones are separated. 
			In clustering, the number of classes and the distribution of 
			instances between classes are unknown and the goal is to find 
			meaningful clusters. 
			One kind of clustering methods is the partitioning-based 
			one. The k-means algorithm [3] is one of the most popu- 
			lar partitioning-based algorithms because it provides a good 
			compromise between the quality of the solution obtained and 
			its computational complexity [4]. K-means aims to find k 
			centroids, one for each cluster, minimizing the sum of the 
			distances of each instance of data from its respective centroid. 
			We can cite other partitioning-based algorithms such as k- 
			medoids or PAM (Partition Around Medoids), which is an 
			evolution of k-means [5]. Hierarchical approaches produce 
			clusters by recursively partitioning data backwards or upwards. 
			For example, in a hierarchical ascending classification or 
			CAH [6], each example from the initial dataset represents a 
			cluster. Then, the clusters are merged, according to a similarity 
			measure, until the desired tree structure is obtained. The result 
			of this clustering method is called a dendrogram. Density- 
			based methods like the EM algorithm [7] assume that the data 
			belonging to each cluster is derived from a specific probability 
			distribution [8]. The idea is to grow a cluster as the density in 
			the neighborhood of the cluster exceeds a predefined threshold. 
			Model-based classification methods like self-organizing 
			map - SOM [9] are focus on finding features to represent each 
			cluster. The most used methods are decision trees and neural 
			networks. Approaches based on semi-supervised learning such 
			as label propagation algorithm [10] are similar to the method 
			proposed in this paper because they consist in using a learning 
			dataset consisting of a few labelled data points to build a 
			model for labelling a larger number of unlabelled data. Closer 
			to the theme of our collection, [11] and [12] use supervised 
			approaches to automatically detect suicidal people in social 
			networks. They extract specific features like word distribution 
			statistics or sentiments to train different machine-learning clas- 
			sifiers and compare performance of machine-learning models 
			against the judgments of psychiatric trainees and mental health 
			professionals. More recently, CLEF challenge in 2018 consists 
			of performing a task on early risk detection of depression on 
			texts written in Social Media1. However, these papers and this 
			task involve tagged data sets, which is the main difference 
			with our proposed approach (we do not have tagged data set). 
			III. RESOURCES AND STATISTICS 
			The association provided a collection of conversations be- 
			tween volunteers and callers between 2005 and 2015, which 
			is called "METICS collection" henceforth. 
			To reduce noise in the collection, we removed all the 
			discussions containing fewer than 15 exchanges between a 
			caller and a person from the association, these exchanges are 
			generally unrepresentative (connection problem, request for 
			information, etc.). We observe particular linguistic phenomena 
			like emoticons2, acronyms, mistakes (spelling, typography, 
			glued words) and an explosive lexical creativity [13]. These 
			phenomena have their origin in the mode of communication 
			(direct or semi-direct), the speed of the composition of the 
			message or in the technological constraints of input imposed 
			by the material (mobile terminal, tablet, etc.). In addition, we 
			used a subset of the collection of the French newspaper, Le 
			Monde to validate our method on a tagged corpus. We only 
			keep articles on television, politics, art, science or economics. 
			Figure 1 presents some descriptive statistics of these two 
			collections. 
			IV. METHODOLOGY 
			A. System Overview 
			Figure 2 presents an overview of the system, each step will 
			be detailed in the rest of the section. In the first step (mod- 
			ule x), we apply different linguistic pre-processing to each 
			discussion. The next module (y) creates a word embedding 
			model with these discussions while the third module (z) uses 
			this model to create specific vectors. The last module ({) 
			performs a prediction for each discussion before separating 
			the collection into clusters based on the predicted class.

			B. Normalization and pre-processing 
			We first extract the textual content of each discussion. In 
			step x, a text normalization is performed to improve the 
			quality of the process. We remove accents, special characters 
			such as "-","/" or "()". Different linguistic processes are used 
			to reduce noise in the model: we remove numbers (numeric 
			and/or textual), special symbols and terms contained in a stop- 
			list adapted to our problem. A lemmatization process was 
			incorporated during the first experiments but it was inefficient 
			considering the typographical variations described in Section 
			III. 
			C. word2vec model 
			In the next step we build a word embedding model using 
			word2vec [14]. We project each word of our corpus in a vector 
			space in order to obtain a semantic representation of these. 
			In this way, words appearing in similar contexts will have a 
			relatively close vector representation. In addition to semantic 
			information, one advantage of such modeling is the production 
			of vector representations of words, depending on the context 
			in which they are encountered. Some words close to a term t in 
			a model learned from a corpus c1 may be very different from 
			those from a model learned from a corpus c2. For example, 
			we observe in figure 3 that the first eight words close to the 
			term "teen" vary according to the corpus used. This example 
			also shows that the use of a generic model like Le Monde in 
			French or Wikipedia is irrelevant in our case, since the corpus 
			corpus words 
			METICS teenager, young, 15years, kid, 
			school, problem , spoiled, teen, 
			Le-Monde sitcom, radio, compote, hearing 
			boy, styx, scamp, rebel 
			Fig. 3. Eight words closest to the term "teenager" according to the type of 
			corpus in learning. 
			of the association is noisy and contains a number of apocopes, 
			abbreviations or acronyms. Different parameters were tested 
			and the configuration with the best results was kept3. 
			D. Specific vectors creation and cluster predictions 
			In this step, we build vectors containing terms that are 
			selected using the word2vec model described in step IV-C. 
			For each theme in the collection, we build a specific linguistic 
			model by performing a word embedding to reconstruct the 
			linguistic context of each theme. We observe, for example, 
			that the terms closest to the thematic "work" are: "unemploy- 
			ment", "job", "stress". Similarly, for the "addiction" theme, 
			we observe the terms: "cannabis", "alcoholism", "drugs" and 
			"heroin". We used this context subsequently to construct a 
			vector, containing the distance distc 
			(i) between each term i 
			and the theme c. Each of these models is independent, so 
			the same term can appear in several models. In this way, 
			we observed that the word "stress" is present in the vector 
			"suicide" and in that of "work", however, the associated weight 
			is different. We varied the size of these vectors between 20 
			and 1000 and the best results were obtained with a size of 400. 
			In the last step {, the system computes an Sc score for each 
			discussion and for each cluster according to each linguistic 
			model such as: 
			Sc 
			(d) = 
			n 
			i=1 
			tf(i) * distc 
			(i) (1) 
			with i the considered term, tf (i) frequency of i in the 
			collection, and distc 
			(i) is the distance between the term i and 
			the thematic c. In the end, the class with the highest score is 
			chosen. 
			V. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS 
			A. Experimental protocol 
			To evaluate the quality of the obtained clusters, we used a 
			subset of the texts of the Le-Monde newspaper, described in 
			Section III, each article having a label according to the theme. 
			For these experiments, we configured the specific vectors (SV) 
			approach with the optimal parameters, as defined in Sections 
			IV-C and IV-D. We also tested the specific vectors without 
			weighting to test the particular influence of this parameter. To 
			highlight the difficulty of the task, we compare our system 
			with a baseline which consists in a random draw, and with 
			3The best results were obtained with the following parameter values: vector 
			size: 700, sliding window size: 5, minimum frequency: 10, vectorization 
			method: skip grams, and a soft hierarchical max function for the model 
			learning. 
			the k-means algorithm [3], commonly used in the literature, 
			as mentioned in Section II. To feed the k-means algorithm, we 
			transformed our initial collection into a bag of words matrix 
			[15] where each conversation is described by the frequency 
			of its words. Each of the experiments was evaluated using the 
			classic measures of Precision, Recall and F-measure, averaged 
			over all classes (with beta = 1 in order not to privilege 
			precision or recall [16]). Since the k-means algorithm does not 
			associate a tag with the final clusters, we have exhaustively 
			calculated the set of solutions to keep only the one yielding 
			the highest F-score.

			Figure 4 presents a summary of the results obtained with 
			each systems. We first observe that baseline scores are very 
			low, but remain relatively close to the theoretical random (0.2) 
			given by the number of classes. Linguistic pre-treatments are 
			not very efficient individually, but improve overall the results 
			of other experiments. The k-means algorithm obtains slightly 
			better results in terms of F-score, but remains weak. Specific 
			vectors get excellent results that outperform other systems with 
			an F-score of 0.54. The execution without weighting improve 
			slightly the recall. 
			C. Cluster Analysis 
			Initial objective of this work was the exploration of the 
			METICS collection, we apply the whole process with the 
			specific vectors approach to automatically categorize all the 
			conversations. We use the Latent Dirichlet Allocation [17] in 
			order to obtain the main topic of each cluster. Figure 5 presents 
			average weight of each thematic keywords according to each 
			clusters. 
			In figure 5, fear, shrink and trust are present designations 
			for each cluster with a largely significant rank; yet, does 
			the writer still express fear when he writes, "I'm afraid of 
			being sick"? Do these designations not participate in opening 
			and constructing spheres of meanings around these pivotal 
			words? Conversely, with a lower rank, but also significant, the 
			designations of thing, difficult, and problem are more vague, 
			but more reformulating to take up the elements involved in 
			writing what is wrong.

			B. Normalization and pre-processing 
			We first extract the textual content of each discussion. In 
			step x, a text normalization is performed to improve the 
			quality of the process. We remove accents, special characters 
			such as "-","/" or "()". Different linguistic processes are used 
			to reduce noise in the model: we remove numbers (numeric 
			and/or textual), special symbols and terms contained in a stop- 
			list adapted to our problem. A lemmatization process was 
			incorporated during the first experiments but it was inefficient 
			considering the typographical variations described in Section 
			III. 
			C. word2vec model 
			In the next step we build a word embedding model using 
			word2vec [14]. We project each word of our corpus in a vector 
			space in order to obtain a semantic representation of these. 
			In this way, words appearing in similar contexts will have a 
			relatively close vector representation. In addition to semantic 
			information, one advantage of such modeling is the production 
			of vector representations of words, depending on the context 
			in which they are encountered. Some words close to a term t in 
			a model learned from a corpus c1 may be very different from 
			those from a model learned from a corpus c2. For example, 
			we observe in figure 3 that the first eight words close to the 
			term "teen" vary according to the corpus used. This example 
			also shows that the use of a generic model like Le Monde in 
			French or Wikipedia is irrelevant in our case, since the corpus 
			corpus words 
			METICS teenager, young, 15years, kid, 
			school, problem , spoiled, teen, 
			Le-Monde sitcom, radio, compote, hearing 
			boy, styx, scamp, rebel 
			Fig. 3. Eight words closest to the term "teenager" according to the type of 
			corpus in learning. 
			of the association is noisy and contains a number of apocopes, 
			abbreviations or acronyms. Different parameters were tested 
			and the configuration with the best results was kept3. 
			D. Specific vectors creation and cluster predictions 
			In this step, we build vectors containing terms that are 
			selected using the word2vec model described in step IV-C. 
			For each theme in the collection, we build a specific linguistic 
			model by performing a word embedding to reconstruct the 
			linguistic context of each theme. We observe, for example, 
			that the terms closest to the thematic "work" are: "unemploy- 
			ment", "job", "stress". Similarly, for the "addiction" theme, 
			we observe the terms: "cannabis", "alcoholism", "drugs" and 
			"heroin". We used this context subsequently to construct a 
			vector, containing the distance distc 
			(i) between each term i 
			and the theme c. Each of these models is independent, so 
			the same term can appear in several models. In this way, 
			we observed that the word "stress" is present in the vector 
			"suicide" and in that of "work", however, the associated weight 
			is different. We varied the size of these vectors between 20 
			and 1000 and the best results were obtained with a size of 400. 
			In the last step {, the system computes an Sc score for each 
			discussion and for each cluster according to each linguistic 
			model such as: 
			Sc 
			(d) = 
			n 
			i=1 
			tf(i) * distc 
			(i) (1) 
			with i the considered term, tf (i) frequency of i in the 
			collection, and distc 
			(i) is the distance between the term i and 
			the thematic c. In the end, the class with the highest score is 
			chosen. 
			V. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS 
			A. Experimental protocol 
			To evaluate the quality of the obtained clusters, we used a 
			subset of the texts of the Le-Monde newspaper, described in 
			Section III, each article having a label according to the theme. 
			For these experiments, we configured the specific vectors (SV) 
			approach with the optimal parameters, as defined in Sections 
			IV-C and IV-D. We also tested the specific vectors without 
			weighting to test the particular influence of this parameter. To 
			highlight the difficulty of the task, we compare our system 
			with a baseline which consists in a random draw, and with 
			3The best results were obtained with the following parameter values: vector 
			size: 700, sliding window size: 5, minimum frequency: 10, vectorization 
			method: skip grams, and a soft hierarchical max function for the model 
			learning. 
			the k-means algorithm [3], commonly used in the literature, 
			as mentioned in Section II. To feed the k-means algorithm, we 
			transformed our initial collection into a bag of words matrix 
			[15] where each conversation is described by the frequency 
			of its words. Each of the experiments was evaluated using the 
			classic measures of Precision, Recall and F-measure, averaged 
			over all classes (with beta = 1 in order not to privilege 
			precision or recall [16]). Since the k-means algorithm does not 
			associate a tag with the final clusters, we have exhaustively 
			calculated the set of solutions to keep only the one yielding 
			the highest F-score.

			Figure 4 presents a summary of the results obtained with 
			each systems. We first observe that baseline scores are very 
			low, but remain relatively close to the theoretical random (0.2) 
			given by the number of classes. Linguistic pre-treatments are 
			not very efficient individually, but improve overall the results 
			of other experiments. The k-means algorithm obtains slightly 
			better results in terms of F-score, but remains weak. Specific 
			vectors get excellent results that outperform other systems with 
			an F-score of 0.54. The execution without weighting improve 
			slightly the recall. 
			C. Cluster Analysis 
			Initial objective of this work was the exploration of the 
			METICS collection, we apply the whole process with the 
			specific vectors approach to automatically categorize all the 
			conversations. We use the Latent Dirichlet Allocation [17] in 
			order to obtain the main topic of each cluster. Figure 5 presents 
			average weight of each thematic keywords according to each 
			clusters. 
			In figure 5, fear, shrink and trust are present designations 
			for each cluster with a largely significant rank; yet, does 
			the writer still express fear when he writes, "I'm afraid of 
			being sick"? Do these designations not participate in opening 
			and constructing spheres of meanings around these pivotal 
			words? Conversely, with a lower rank, but also significant, the 
			designations of thing, difficult, and problem are more vague, 
			but more reformulating to take up the elements involved in 
			writing what is wrong.

Conclusion :
null			The rate of information growth due to the World Wide Web has called for a need 
			to develop efficient and accurate summarization systems. Although research on 
			summarization started about 50 years ago, there is still a long trail to walk in 
			this field. Over time, attention has drifted from summarizing scientific articles to 
			news articles, electronic mail messages, advertisements, and blogs. Both abstractive 
			and extractive approaches have been attempted, depending on the application at 
			hand. Usually, abstractive summarization requires heavy machinery for language 
			generation and is difficult to replicate or extend to broader domains. In contrast, 
			simple extraction of sentences have produced satisfactory results in large-scale ap- 
			plications, specially in multi-document summarization. The recent popularity of 
			effective newswire summarization systems confirms this claim. 
			This survey emphasizes extractive approaches to summarization using statisti- 
			cal methods. A distinction has been made between single document and multi- 
			document summarization. Since a lot of interesting work is being done far from 
			the mainstream research in this field, we have chosen to include a brief discussion 
			on some methods that we found relevant to future research, even if they focus only 
			on small details related to a general summarization process and not on building an 
			entire summarization system. 
			Finally, some recent trends in automatic evaluation of summarization systems 
			have been surveyed. The low inter-annotator agreement figures observed during 
			manual evaluations suggest that the future of this research area heavily depends on 
			the ability to find efficient ways of automatically evaluating these systems and on 
			the development of measures that are objective enough to be commonly accepted 
			by the research community.

			In this paper we presented WiSeBE, a semi-automatic multi-reference sentence 
			boundary evaluation protocol based on the necessity of having a more reliable 
			way for evaluating the SBD task. We showed how WiSeBE is an inclusive metric 
			which not only evaluates the performance of a system against all references, but 
			also takes into account the agreement between them. According to your point 
			of view, this inclusivity is very important given the difficulties that are present 
			when working with spoken language and the possible disagreements that a task 
			like SBD could provoke. 
			WiSeBE shows to be correlated with standard SBD metrics, however we 
			want to measure its correlation with extrinsic evaluations techniques like auto- 
			matic summarization and machine translation.

			We think that this work means an important step 
			for the RST research in Spanish, and that the RST 
			Spanish Treebank will be useful to carry out 
			diverse researches about RST in this language, 
			from a descriptive point of view (ex. analysis of 
			texts from different domains or genres) and an 
			applied point of view (development of discourse 
			parsers and NLP applications, like automatic 
			summarization, automatic translation, IE, etc.). 
			For the moment the corpus' size is acceptable 
			and, though the percentage of double-annotated 
			texts is not very high, we think that having 10 
			annotators (using the same annotation manual) 
			avoids the bias of only one annotator. In addition, 
			the corpus includes texts of diverse domains and 
			genres, which provides us with a heterogeneous 
			Spanish corpus. Moreover, the corpus interface 
			that we have designed allows the user to select a 
			subcorpus and to analyze it statistically. In 
			addition, we think that it is essential to release a 
			free corpus, on-line and dynamic, that is, in 
			continuous growth. Nevertheless, we are conscious 
			that our work still has certain limitations, which we 
			will try to solve in the future. In the short term, we 
			have 5 aims: 
			a) To add one more annotator for the test corpus 
			and to measure inter-annotator agreement. 
			b) To use more agreement measures, like kappa. 
			c) To reach a consensus on the annotation of the 
			test corpus, in order to establish a set of texts 
			considered as a preliminary gold standard. 
			d) To finish and to evaluate the IE tool. 
			e) To analyze the corpus to extract linguistic 
			patterns for the automatic relations detection. 
			In the long term, we consider other aims: 
			f) To increase the corpus, by adding non- 
			specialized texts, and new domains and genres. 
			g) To annotate all the texts by 3 people, to get a 
			representative gold-standard for Spanish (this aim 
			will depend on the funding of the project).

			The paper reports our experiments and results for building

			In this article, we presented an unsupervised approach to 
			exploring a collection of stories about human distress. This 
			approach uses a word embedding model to build vectors 
			containing only vocabulary from the linguistic context of the 
			model. We evaluated the quality of the approach on a col- 
			lection labeled with classical measures. The detailed analysis 
			showed very good results (average Fscore of 0.54) compared 
			to the other systems tested. This method of analysis has also 
			made it possible to highlight semantic universes and thematic 
			groupings. We first intend to study in more detail the influence 
			of each of the parameters on the results obtained. We are also 
			planning to be able to assign several tags to each discussion, 
			which would allow thematic overlaps to be taken into account.

Discussion :
null			In this paper we have described SMMR, a scal- 
			able sentence scoring method based on MMR that 
			achieves very promising results. An important as- 
			pect of our sentence scoring method is that it does 
			not requires re-ranking nor linguistic knowledge, 
			which makes it a simple and fast approach to the 
			issue of update summarization. It was pointed out 
			at the DUC 2007 workshop that Question Answer- 
			ing and query-oriented summarization have been 
			converging on a common task. The value added 
			by summarization lies in the linguistic quality. Ap- 
			proaches mixing IR techniques are well suited for 
			query-oriented summarization but they require in- 
			tensive work for making the summary fluent and 
			coherent. Among the others, this is a point that we 
			think is worthy of further investigation.

			value 
			to scale the performance of CT 
			over RW 
			. RGAR 
			can intuitively be consider an 
			agreement value over all elements of R. To test this hypothesis, we computed
