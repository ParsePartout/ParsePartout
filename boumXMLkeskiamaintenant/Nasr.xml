	<abstract>
	MACAON is a tool suite for standard NLP tasks developed for French. MACAON has been designed to process both human-produced text and highly ambiguous word-lattices produced by NLP tools. MACAON is made of several native modules for common tasks such as a tokenization, a part-of-speech tagging or syntactic parsing, all communicating with each other through XML files . In addition, exchange protocols with external tools are easily definable. MACAON is a fast, modular and open tool, distributed under GNU Public License.

	<introduction>
	The automatic processing of textual data generated by NLP software, resulting from Machine Translation, Automatic Speech Recognition or Automatic Text Summarization, raises new challenges for language processing tools. Unlike native texts (texts produced by humans), this new kind of texts is the result of imperfect processors and they are made of several hypotheses, usually weighted with confidence measures. Automatic text production systems can produce these weighted hypotheses as nbest lists, word lattices, or confusion networks. It is crucial for this space of ambiguous solutions to be kept for later processing since the ambiguities of the lower levels can sometimes be resolved during highlevel processing stages. It is therefore important to be able to represent this ambiguity.
