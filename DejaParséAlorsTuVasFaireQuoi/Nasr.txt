Abstract :
			MACAON is a tool suite for standard NLP tasks developed for French. MACAON has been designed to process both human-produced text and highly ambiguous word-lattices produced by NLP tools. MACAON is made of several native modules for common tasks such as a tokenization, a part-of-speech tagging or syntactic parsing, all communicating with each other through XML files . In addition, exchange protocols with external tools are easily definable. MACAON is a fast, modular and open tool, distributed under GNU Public License.
