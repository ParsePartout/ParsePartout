Abstract :
			MACAON is a tool suite for standard NLP tasks developed for French. MACAON has been designed to process both human-produced text and highly ambiguous word-lattices produced by NLP tools. MACAON is made of several native modules for common tasks such as a tokenization, a part-of-speech tagging or syntactic parsing, all communicating with each other through XML files . In addition, exchange protocols with external tools are easily definable. MACAON is a fast, modular and open tool, distributed under GNU Public License.

Conclusion :
			In this paper we have presented MACAON, an NLP
			tool suite which allows to process native text as well
			as several hypotheses automatically produced by an
			ASR or an MT system. Several evolutions are cur-
			rently under development, such as a named entity
			recognizer component and an interface with a de-
			pendency parser.
