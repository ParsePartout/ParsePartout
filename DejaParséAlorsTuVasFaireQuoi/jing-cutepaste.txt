Abstract :
			We present a cut and paste based text summarizer, which uses operations derived from an analysis of human written abstracts. The summarizer edits extracted sentences, using reduction to remove inessential phrases and combination to merge resuiting phrases together as coherent sentences. Our work includes a statistically based sentence decomposition program that identifies where the phrases of a summary originate in the original document, producing an aligned corpus of summaries and articles which we used to develop the summarizer.

Conclusion :
			This paper presents a novel architecture for text
			summarization using cut and paste techniques ob-
			served in human-written abstracts. In order to auto-
			matically analyze a large quantity of human-written
			abstracts, we developed a decomposition program.
			The automatic decomposition allows us to build
			large corpora for studying sentence reduction and
			sentence combination, which are two effective op-
			erations in cut and paste. We developed a sentence
			reduction module that makes reduction decisions us-
			ing multiple sources of knowledge. We also investi-
			gated possible sentence combination operations and
			implemented the combination module. A sentence
			extraction module was developed and used as the
			front end of the summarization system.
			We are preparing the task-based evaluation of the
			overall system. We also plan to evaluate the porta-
			bility of the system by testing it on another corpus.
			We will also extend the system to query-based sum-
			marization and investigate whether the system can
			be modified for multiple document summarization.
