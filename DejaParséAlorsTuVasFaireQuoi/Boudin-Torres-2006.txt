Abstract :
			We present SMMR, a scalable sentence scoring method for query-oriented update summarization. Sentences are scored thanks to a criterion combining query relevance and dissimilarity with already read documents (history). As the amount of data in history increases, non-redundancy is prioritized over query-relevance. We show that SMMR achieves promising results on the DUC 2007 update corpus.

Conclusion :


Discussion :
			In this paper we have described SMMR, a scal-
			able sentence scoring method based on MMR that
			achieves very promising results. An important as-
			pect of our sentence scoring method is that it does
			not requires re-ranking nor linguistic knowledge,
			which makes it a simple and fast approach to the
			issue of update summarization. It was pointed out
			at the DUC 2007 workshop that Question Answer-
			ing and query-oriented summarization have been
			converging on a common task. The value added
			by summarization lies in the linguistic quality. Ap-
			proaches mixing IR techniques are well suited for
			query-oriented summarization but they require in-
			tensive work for making the summary fluent and
			coherent. Among the others, this is a point that we
			think is worthy of further investigation.
