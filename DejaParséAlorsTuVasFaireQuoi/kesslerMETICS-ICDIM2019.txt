Abstract :
			In order to better adapt to society, an association has developed a web chat application that allows anyone to express and share their concerns and anguishes. Several thousand anonymous conversations have been gathered and form a new corpus of stories about human distress and social violence. We present a method of corpus analysis combining unsupervised learning and word embedding in order to bring out the themes of this particular collection. We compare this approach with a standard algorithm of the literature on a labeled corpus and obtain very good results. An interpretation of the obtained clusters collection confirms the interest of the method.

Conclusion :
			In this article, we presented an unsupervised approach to
			exploring a collection of stories about human distress. This
			approach uses a word embedding model to build vectors
			containing only vocabulary from the linguistic context of the
			model. We evaluated the quality of the approach on a col-
			lection labeled with classical measures. The detailed analysis
			showed very good results (average Fscore of 0.54) compared
			to the other systems tested. This method of analysis has also
			made it possible to highlight semantic universes and thematic
			groupings. We first intend to study in more detail the influence
			of each of the parameters on the results obtained. We are also
			planning to be able to assign several tags to each discussion,
			which would allow thematic overlaps to be taken into account.
			The analysis reinforces the cluster approach to highlight the
			defining features of this type of speech production and to
			reveal its inner workings. This entry by the discursive routines
			is only one example which will then make it possible to
			approach other explorations with a particular focus on the
			argumentative forms and on the forms of intensity.
